Food is sometimes sometimes great and somethings just good. Wasn't a fan of their brunch but lunch and dinner is good.  Service is hit and miss.,3,ewaMkuxfjfCX3ndtk0oRTw
They should seriously market the sausage and gravy. You may hear chicken sausage but - good Lord this is some amazing sausage biscuits and gravy.,4,SzkuvIpf0lcVaDgk5x2ipg
"While I have had several average salon and spa services at Holts this review is for my hair coloring experiences with Ina.

I have had my blonde highlights done by Ina on and off for a few years. I was always very happy with the results, yet I was kept trying to look for a more reasonably priced place because it is very expensive indeed (in my case about $300 with the toner and blow dry, which is not included).

And so it was that a month before my wedding I went to a very reputable downtown salon (supposedly the best in to) to have my highlights done. To make a very long and painful story short, my hair was butchered, orange, brassy, horrible. I did actually cry...so I went to Ina, to see if she could do anything to fix it, and she did. It was a very, very! long process; she put in new highlights and once the foils were in brushed with darker dye the rest of my hair, strand my strand...the result was absolutely amazing.

The bottom line is: she is good. She knows what to mix to get an ashy shade, she knows what will match your skin tone, she knows how thick/ think the highlights should be, where they should be...so I have decided that I would rather have my hair highlighted twice a year rather than every 3 months, but go to Ina rather than hopelessly keep trying to find a colorist that knows what they are doing.",5,ZGg6emL3sqhyyqHD_DJEag
"I have been coming to NCS for almost two years. I had been going to a salon in the mall for about a year and I noticed that my hair was getting extremely dry. I used some products that they recommended but nothing seemed to help.
A friend recommended Sara D so I made an appointment with her hoping that she would be able to make some suggestions for my dry and damaged hair. She suggested one product and gave me tips for drying and styling that would help. Since that first visit, my hair has come along way. Sara always gives me suggestions for keeping my hair healthy and she'll recommend different products in the store but never pushes me to purchase a product. She always asks what my budget is and what I'm looking to have done so that I'm not disappointed with the outcome. I'd highly recommend Sara - or any of the other stylists.",5,IXYLmBVvRVFJZEhnhE_YsQ
"This place should be renamed to ""We Take Our Sweet Ass Time"" Large Fried Chicken.

Jks, but seriously.  There was no line, and only 3 people waiting in front of me for their order, and it still took a good 15 minutes to receive my order.

I ordered the regular chicken w/ the strawberry drink (forgot what it's called).  The chicken was pretty good, I must admit.  The drink, however, was decent - tasted like strawberry Sprite -  but not worth ~$3.50.

Come here only if you have time to spare.",2,dao7SEXhBuMk7TieM4gEZA
"very friendly staff and bartender. Very inexpensive and good. Bar food only.
Quaint!",4,sww01HVWPhpF6nS-aBTJCw
Olive Garden just sucks period. Not this location in particular but the entire chain. I ordered 2   tour of Italy to go and the portion size was so small! Ummmm at $17+ per entree I expected a comparable amount of food. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY OG has truly minimized their product. They should just close them all.,1,MQd4V_JrWKbH4GQy2LcklQ
"I have had the pleasure to eat at this restaurant. While not all pizza is the same they do make an amazing Calzone and Alfredo Pasta which I had sirachi sauce added. The kids and family are always greeted at the door by the host and or owner which is a nice change from the bid scale eateries. This is a great small business and would recommend everyone to try. Remember if you don't get the same level of service that we have had, please speak up and talk with the management or owner. They deserve the opportunity make your experience enjoyable. Owe and the cheese steak Calzone with sauce on the side is number 1 for this guy.",5,qNGpnqm1PabbXoFejrDN7Q
"I recieved a dozen chocolate cover strawberries from the Decatur location on May 6th. After we came home from dinner I got out my box they smelled amazing but the strawberry was mushy and already sitting in liquid.  By Saturday morning they were mushy, soggy, messy strawberries sitting in over 70% liquid, just a large not edible mess.  I tried calling on Sumday and got hung up on over and over again.  On Monday I finally got a person on the phone.  I was told there was no manager available.  I explained the issue and she told me sorry you must of got a bad box.  She offered to replace the strawberries, but at this point I didn't want more strawberries concerned I would get more of the same.  I asked if I could get either bananas, pineapple or apples.  They had a box for less money with a mix of strawberries, bananas and pineapple, which I was interested in.  She explained they had been so busy over the weekend they had NO fruit.  This was after 12 in the afternoon, surely they should have gotten a delivery and if not for emergencies run to the grocery store right next door.  I said it didn't have to be today but I guess they never expected another delivery of fruit ever again.  She said the only thing she could do was refund the person who paid which was my mother in law.  I hung up and called my mother in law and told her I loved her idea but they were horrible and they would be contacting her for info so they could refund her.  It's now five days later and no one has called her for the refund and I never got anything edible.  They are liars and thieves.  If you want your special day for that special person messed up this is the place to call.  I have called back today but still no manager.  This was edible arrangements located at 1291 s. Decatur Blvd. 140, Las Vegas, NV 89102 phone 702-822-4469.  
Absolutely the worst customer service and product I have ever recieved for my birthday.  Thank you for screwing it up and showing me you don't run a reputable or honest business.",1,jWGvg-3DJ2-BH0cl0AVMOg
"This is a fantastic venue. Big open space, nice mezzanine for viewing, nice bartenders. Sound was amazing as well. Dua Lipa rocked the house down! But the MOST important thing for me was the security. EVERY security person I interacted with was incredibly kind. I've been to many venues in the valley and they always have these macho bro-ed out dudes that are rude and pushy, but NOT here at the Van Buren. They were all so nice and orderly, I have never experienced that at a music venue. The one 'bad' thing I'd say is the woman who was running the seating on the mezzanine takes her job WAY too seriously and could not be bothered about anything, even when we had questions, but that one negative isn't deterring me from still leaving a 5 star review for everything else. Can't wait to see another show here, I know I'll be treated kindly by the bartenders and security peeps! Thank you!",5,vOB18ADiMpld8AuZkCvpcA
"My lovely daughter, VERONICA gifted me a visit here for my birthday! I loved this place nice and intimate. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. I am going to make sure and return. Thank you my lovely daughter!!!",5,PUxVE9WnPiTq1If4vg6Jjw
"No 25 year old should have this much fun in a candy store. 

My nephew wanted to come here to look at the the giant Chocolate Statue of Liberty. We ended up staying for at least an hour. They have so much cool stuff here! I bought a shot glass, he got a cupcake (I stole a bite -SO GOOD), and we both left with way too many pictures!",5,U4vpPUwg716Dxnu6uCONJA
My coworkers favorite place to get lunch. I've had several dishes and have nothing but good things to say. Friendly service and great food.,5,gGsH8R7WL7-9a84M52Ro4g
Epic. These guy BROUGHT US A TABLE. We just sat in the middle of nowhere on some chairs and they BROUGHT THE TABLE.  Quality. The margs are great too.,5,piANZ7zBJbnXPacwNJn2ag
"I have had my nails done here for years.  Recently, I went to Elle with my daughter and two of her bridesmaids for gel manicures and pedicures.  All our nails ended up looking lovely, and the salon was very accommodating in staying open past normal closing time to make sure we were all finished properly.
There were some communication issues, and I was cut by the inexperienced tech, but otherwise it was a great experience and we will definitely be continuing our business here.  Their prices are reasonable, the salon is very clean, the massage time is extra long, and they offer many types of special details if you like flowers or designs on your toes.",5,SWG-l7ibKyhadaga_t2TPw
"There is no question, this is our favorite Indian buffet in Charlotte. The food is amazing and always very fresh. There are many options for vegetarians and non-veg (me). I don't know what it is about the University area and great Indian food, but this is definitely the best around. The malai kofta is always my favorite. Chicken tikka masala, paneer, tandoori chicken, fresh naan, and there's always something new to try. Fresh gulab jamun too for dessert which is delicious. We usually go to the lunch buffett on Saturday which is always slamming. It can be very crowded at times, just be patient, everyone is very friendly and just wants to get down with some good food, especially hungry college students!",5,V2TS0XD5B17eCeXR68MELw
"Yep..I heard about these amazing red velvet pancakes and had to drag the family to that side of town and try em.
Of course the hubby had to try the grilled cheese and FF. They off the fries seasoned which is nice. His sandwich was pretty ordinary but he was happy.
I had the special which was a breakfast burrito and that came with 2 of the best pancakes EVER!!
They come with a small jar of cream cheese syrup and they are sprinkled with chocolate bits and a huge spoonful of whipped cream.
1st the burrito..it was perfect. I had ham in mine since my little guy loves it and we were sharing. We both tore into it. It had just the right amount of cheese,potato,ham, and eggs. We ate the whole thing.
Now onto the most wonderful pancakes in the world...
One word: YUMMY!!!!!
Go get some NOW!!! These are amazing. Then do some serious cardio cuz god only knows how much sugar/calories there are in them.
I also ate them both and did not share with the hubby or my baby!
LOL
Its a bit pricey..our bill was almost $24 bucks plus 5 buck tip. And it was on the other side of town. But I will drive here again  for THOSE pancakes.
Oh..service was also fantastic!",4,11I_22vRNuQJio8xvoiOpw
"I have had their CornHash and their Bloody Mary both great. Their french toast are good and their hispanic entrees are also great, tasty and authentic.",5,Mp3YyML26WEWI2UuO_o9OQ
"Uhmmmmm let me just say, holy hell !! My husband and I ordered a heart shaped strawberry cheesecake from here for our wedding and it was tastier than a grass fed filet mignon; and if you know me, you know I love me some grassy heifers. For the first bite, we dug right in, hand and all and shoved it in each other's face. It was so good we nearly licked it off each other's face. TMI? Whatever!! Their cakes are BAUSS!!!",5,jIoxaN8hWsKkor37M408iA
"I came back to Agio last night (a year later) from my last review. Most of my previous review still stands, but I definitely had a wonderful experience which is why I give this 5/5. This is not your typical, fast paced restaurant. The chef really makes each meal from scratch and alone, so yes, your meal in a bigger group or depending what you order may come out first before the others. It's definitely a homey feel. You really need to have patience if you want to eat here. For my experience, I thought the pace was great since we ordered lots!

I made a 7pm reservation for Friday, and when I arrived only a table of 6 were in the restaurant. The server was really kind, and she gave us her recommendations. I had called in advance to ask for 2 orders of the lobster risotto, since I had a few colleagues rave about it recently and thought I just had to try. We also ordered caprese salad, fried calamari, linguine alla vongole - clams in white wine pesto sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, as well as the mushroom gnocchi. Yes - this many dishes shared between 4 people. We started with bread, as well as an app on the house (grilled zucchini with squash on top). Everything was delicious. I would prefer to try the grilled calamari next time though. In terms of the lobster risotto, it's not a traditional risotto but made in tomato sauce. If you love lobster, this dish or the lobster pasta is your ideal meal. It comes with a whole lobster! I would also recommend the linguine with clams, and the mushroom gnocchi was so delicious. Tasted fresh, and full of flavour.

At the end of our meal, the Chef also gave us creme brulee on the house - also the best creme brulee I've ever had. Just the perfect crust, and the dessert itself wasn't overly sweet. I'll definitely be back and hopefully it would take me a year to do so. This place is a gem!",4,az6ShoIpYnNIV5lbPNV86g
"Beautiful, we were in town for the Lake Las Vegas golf tournament, we are pickleball players so called this private club for possible day use of a court?

"READ MY REVIEW, THEN THE OTHER 200+ ONE STAR RATINGS WITH NEGATIVE REVIEWS! ITS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO AT LEAST OBTAIN 2 OR 3 ESTIMATES PRIOR TO USING PARKER AND SONS. IT WILL SAVE YOU FROM HAVING TO WRITE REVIEWS LIKE THIS.

I went to Home Depot last weekend to purchase two Rheem water heaters. I was advised that Parker and Sons was the company used to install Home Depot water heaters. The technician came to my house this morning, conducted a 5 minute walk through of both existing water heaters then spent 20 minutes in his truck writing an estimate. The estimate was $5,538! When I asked the technician how in the world the price could be so high, he responded, ""that's our pricing on """"our"""" water heaters. I told him this estimate was set up by Home Depot not Parker and Sons. He continued to tell me the pricing was for Parker and Sons water heaters. The water heater from Home Depot was $850 each, how could Parker and Sons charge an additional approx. $2,000 per unit to install? They said it was to bring my current water heater up to code and pull a permit.  I called the city of Scottsdale and they informed me the only cost that would be needed was a water pressure valve ($14) and a permit ($44). The remaining items on my current units are up to code and would easily pass in inspection. Parker and Sons pays it's technicians commission for every job they are on. They will try to increase the price to receive that commission. This is a predatory business practice. Just look at all the reviews on Parker and Sons, they are almost all based on being mislead and over charged.

UPDATE: Angie, please read my entire review prior to responding next time. My main complaint isn't just pricing. I called this estimate through Home Depot to purchase a water heater from Home Depot. The technician quoted me a Parker and Sons water heater based on Parker and Sons pricing, not Home Depot pricing. There is no need to have a supervisor call me. I've already spoken with Paul Kelly, owner of Parker and Sons this morning.  I will leave our conversation of the review but I can assure everyone reading this review that I addressed my concern regarding the technician and company of this predatory business practice. He assured me he will investigate and follow up with me. 

UPDATE: I just received an estimate to install from Huntington Home Improvement for $750, all parts and haul away of both old units included.",1,VcFZy6FFCTbMiz0rsID00w
"So amazingly enough I've been here two separate times - but for the same occasion:  a friend's birthday dinner.  Since my visits were literally separated by a year, it's good to see that this place has staying power.

Located in Uptown, it is definitely an experience to go eat here.  Both birthday dinner times were with a large crowd 8-10 and we had reservations.  Once everyone arrived, we were promptly sat at our table and the servers got our drink orders and food orders.  The chef/entertainer comes out and confirms all our orders and then starts cooking right in front of us.

I'm a sucker for showmanship, but the chefs pull out all the tricks:  flaming onion volcano, fake ketchup bottle squirting, etc.  Probably the funnest thing is when the chef offers everyone some sake and proceeds to squirt the sake in peoples mouths until they had enough.  This latest visit was the entire table catching broccoli in their mouths...

Good times -  The staff are really good here keeping your drinks flowing and catering to your needs.  I'd say its a solid ""birthday dinner place.""",5,56y7FJpKXeQwplchKSTsXw
"I had the Greek chicken wrap and I thought it was quite good.  The feta paired nicely with the chicken, onions, and lettuce inside.  My parents had the caprese grilled cheese and brisket sandwich and they seemed to enjoy those as well.  The only complaint is the inefficiency of the ordering and food delivery.  They seemed quite understaffed.",4,Wsx5vsBp7exwxjSAfygXkA
"I am writing a second review, this yelp must think a negative review has a personal agenda.  I assure you, I do not.

I went to this place as a walk-in.  I was duped on the pricing (printed brochures and menus post one price but when I was done,  I was told it was higher) .  I witnessed another customer having this problem as she was checking out as well.

Regardless, the pedi was horrible.  Toes were cut unevenly, I had polish on the skin, and it was overall, the worst pedi of my life, and for a price that is WAY over the competition in the area.

There is a reason this place is empty - women of North Scottsdale won't tolerate this kind of work.",1,QAnTWxRVyftK-kZnsGmuhg
"Free entrance and open bar?!!?!?!? You gotta be kidding me, we hit the jackpot! Some promoters on the strip convinced us to go so we hit it up. We were just walking around trying to find clubs to go to so we had nothing to lose. It's located in the back alley behind Fatburger, kinda sketchy location. We went in and they were playing house, I was like Ooo yeah, it's on!! They DJ played great music, however there wasn't many people there. My friends and I just formed a circle and housed/breaked most of the time, some other people would come up in our circle and session with us too. If there were more people, it'd be a lot better. I believe it's open from 2:00am until 8:00am. We came on a Thursday night, however when we came on a Saturday night, it wasn't free. I think it was about 5:00am, sun almost out, and they were charging a cover. The open bar was cool on Thursday night, however the drinks were pretty watered down. It has potential to be good, but I dunno how many people party that late. I was getting tired by 5:00am-6:00am.",3,xFTlbwEcJLAPRNkYCCpauQ
"I can only review the nonpareils and truffle sampler.   The nonpareils are very low quality dark chocolate and for 14.00 per pound definitely not worth it.   The truffles had two salted, one of which was milk chocolate.  They were so salty that the chocolate flavor did not come through.  I have to assume that the chocolate with  name brand wrappers are better than the ones they make in house.",1,Oz0tnPC_WwAEYlAkCjf1qQ
"Love this place! Even when they're busy they treat you like family. Not a stuffy corporate store, but still very professional. Handled all of my supplement needs and then some. The expert advice is well worth the price of admission! I wish I lived closer to this particular location.",5,vg4fJqZIbdI3_UjoV2vgIw
"Disappointing return visit reminds us that a restaurant can change very quickly depending on food quality and service.

Our 2nd time here, we had a very curt and unfriendly waiter who forgot to refill drinks, forgot cutlery, mixed up orders and finally delivered ice cream that was inexplicably savory.

This is an all you can eat and cook Korean style restaurant where you order your raw proteins, cook on the burner in your table and enjoy.  You might imagine that you can begin to enjoy cooking unless you have utensils but our waiter, constantly running between tables, had this annoying reply to our requests ""I will get it later, ok?""

Food quality was mixed. The beef and short ribs were good. The sushi was fast and seemingly well prepared. There was a white fish that disintegrated into a mush when cooked - we suspected it had gone bad. Little shot glass servings of ice cream - you have a choice of mango or green tea - were presented to us without spoons (later, ok?) and ended up spit-out-savory as in ""what the hell kind of ice cream was that?""

Our meal concluded with a bill that included a 10% service charge which our waiter explained went to the restaurant but that he would only get whatever we tipped him. Wtf? I've been to restaurants that automatically add a tip to parties of 6 or more but the waiter doesn't ask for another cut.

Fortunately there are a lot of Korean grill restaurants in Toronto - if Chaco doesn't get their act together (the place was half empty on a sat night), they're not going to be around for the long run.",2,iUB-RXrU0hjkJIlsbTWDdg
"Diners beware!  Extremely poor service here.  We placed an order through JustEats but it did not go through.  The kid behind the counter refused to check my order number and simply said they never received it.  He finally called JustEats and said he rejected my order because we tried to abuse the coupon code the past few days.  It was our first time there and only discovered the code today, so it couldn't of been us.  He refused to compare my phone number to the number he claimed made the previous orders.

Anyways, it was a terrible customer service experience and I left empty handed after 20 long minutes at the restaurant.  The kid was rude and unhelpful, and honestly think he made up the excuse because he wanted to close up shop.  It's the last time I'm stepping foot in the restaurant until the service improves, they've got to realize there are TONS of other pizza options around the neighbourhood.",1,GxCSmlM3Y58kmzNweZ1kcQ
"I decided to give this place a try based on their high reviews from yelp. I was in need of a gel manicure before Chinese New Years. I decided to stop by, since walk ins are available. 
The decoration and atmosphere was very cute and bright. I really enjoy going to nail salons that are welcoming and bright. 
I went during my lunch break asking if they could take me in. I didn't have to wait which was a major plus since I only had a hour break. 
They offer a lot of different varieties of color and shades! 
The service itself is great, but the execution was done poorly. I'm usually not very picky when it comes to people doing my nails. However, I felt like I was doing my own nails. The gel wasn't painted evenly and I have random extra paint on some nails. 
When I was done I noticed a part of my nail wasn't even painted. When I told them they quickly apologized and offered to fix it. Usually my gel manicures cost $35 without tip, but they only charge $30 for a basic gel manicure. I rather spend an extra five dollars for a better job. 
It's very unfortunately, but I most likely will not be returning. I do appreciate their service and walk ins.",3,i2v6aFPD5jKByQIJswYoUw
"We ate at Franco's tonight for the second time.  Tonight I started off with Chicken Pastina soup. It was better than my Grandma's recipe straight from Italy.  That is saying a lot. Next I split  two dinners with my Father because we could not decide. The Virgina Spots(Sea Bass) were outstanding. Small portion but I was expecting that when you order spots.  My Dad got the Veal special with 2 large shrimp. My Dad doesn't eat shrimp so it was a bonus for me.  They were cooked in some sort of light red sauce. I don't remember what it was called. It seemed to be a mix between tomato and Marsala. Not sure what the veal was like because my Dad did not share, which is unusual for him. The only reason for the 4 stars is the food took forever to come out. The servers were very good but the food should not take this long on a Monday at 5:30. It was worth the wait though. We will return soon.",4,IY2DsXVYQiKCP9cz_7MMEQ
"The office staff is really nice and do their job well.  Aside from that the place isn't very great. The carpet I believe you can catch herpes off of, the appliances are all outdated, the blinds have holes through them and are torn, the cops are here everyday, people literally knock on your door trying to sell you stolen things, we have had hella plumbing problems, there is a roach infestation and the refuse to come and spray even though they keep telling us they will. Last night seven people were arrested and bullets were fired through a window after the police burst down their door.  This place isn't safe for anyone but definitely not family friendly. Save your money and go somewhere else.",2,J52sw7gfAhgHURLP8tgT7A
"Have been here for brunch, dinner, and just drinks, I think my favorite was brunch because the omelette was so good but dinner isn't far behind. The food here is quite delicious, and creative while still being pub-y. $4 Caesars on a Saturday morning is fantastic, and the brew coffee is actually decent, which seems to be a hard thing to come by at restaurants these days. My friend had the Benny which I tasted and it's rich but damn it's good.",4,ZeczPTXh3AxrEZAKKe_hcw
"So, despite the reviews, I decided it would still be worth a look around and since I've never been to the top of Place Ville Marie, I'd at least appreciate the novelty and the view.  I found the place quite decent without lineups for the Saturday brunch time.  The food was average and my eggs Benedict tasted like they had been sitting there all morning just waiting for me to show up, that or the A/C seriously cooled it down before it made it to my table.  The earthy Benedict was rather tasty (as there was bacon in it!) and in general I'd say the food presentation is decent as well. How was the service? Nice and slow... So you better get a good window seat to enjoy the view while waiting. I would say that it's better to go to the resto and get food and a complimentary view than just to go to the observation deck alone so I would say it's definitely worth a visit.",3,gd6JXiuyOeXJRqH5lSG-Og
"Came here on a Thursday evening. The place was empty, which was surprising given the high ratings on here. We had wonton soup, which was weak for broth but wontons were good. Also had a variety of dumplings and steamy buns, which were good also. Not sure if I'd go out if my way to come back but it hits the spot when dim sum is needed.",4,UrUmNbK_v2PyQ5OdZz7VOg
If you need an inexpensive way to and from your strip hotel makes sure you use Bell. I have used them on 3 different trips to Vegas so far and I have never been let down. Drivers have always been professional and vehicles have always been clean. Also great because you can arrange your transportation needs before you get into town and go straight to the dispatch stand. VIP Shuttle is my favorite way to and from the airport.,5,cMX_OAUfquejxdZ-TBgN4A
"Went with my partner thinking that we could get the ""all you can eat"" experience that every other Maki offers. They denied it to us on a busier day, portions and prices were not reasonable at all, and they snuck in a shady %15 service charge.

A more reasonable solution would have been to just limit the amount of items their customers could order in a busier time. Instead, they capitalized on the influx of customers for an easy cash grab.

NOT RECOMMENDED.",1,1VPtbLT9AAIhNenetmsThA
"Last Fri.(03-11) my husband passed away at the VA hosp. In Madison WI. I stopped by your restaurant to eat before I headed back home, 70 miles, cashier was very attentive, noticed I'd been crying, inquired, I told her, placed my order, went to get my water & wait for my to go order, when the little gal brought out my order, she asked if she could give me a hug, the cashier had told her what had happen, here comes the cashier, and she gave me back my cost of my meal, saying they were paying for my mid-afternoon lunch. Thank you so very much for your thoughtfulness. I will be patronizing their establishment in the future. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",1,44ZkwdDIdRQ2-AUbErYDDQ
"5 stars had there not been a smell on the second visit and a little less responsive daytime staff. 

The food is excellent here and the service when we had dinner here was personable and prompt. The best anyone could ask for. 

We kinda sampled it all. Some kind of chicken appetizer kabob creation (awesomely grilled), a vegetarian pizza that was ridiculously good, and the pot roast dinner. We split it all and it was just great all the way around. Will go again. 

Pricey (especially wine) but good.",5,Forqk33tmRjC_oe4QWO4WA
"For the chicken sandwich alone, I would give this place 4 stars for taste to price ratio (~$8 sandwich). The chicken is juicy on the inside, and has a really good crunch on the outside. The sandwich is garnished with cucumber, lettuce, and isn't over saturated with seasoning/sauces. For add-ins, the wasabi honey is my favorite. It's just a hint of heat and sweetness, although the sandwich is good alone. Also, I am a fan of their fries and coleslaw. The fries are thin, shoe-string type and they are crispy on the outside and mashed potato-y on the inside, and not so greasy. I am usually not a fan of coleslaw mostly because I do not like mayo, but this coleslaw was pretty good! It is vinegary and not very creamy at all, which might not appeal to some people but was good for me. They also have their own recipe sodas and sweet and ice tea. The root beer is bomb.",4,SOKL_KRv3qo4jHKgYm38yg
"I came in one day, to get prices for 2 ""black"" caps for center of my wheels, for my Jeep.  A super-nice attendant helped me, (I won't reveal his name), he ordered up the two caps, and I confirmed with him, that they were black.  He was very confident and assured me, yes, they'll be black.
After going in, to pick up the two caps, only to find that the order was for chrome (ooops!!), I got to re-order these caps in black, after *razzing* said clerk.  :)  They (Discount Tire) let me order as many as I needed (4, with an extra one for the spare tire), and did not charge me anything above what I had already paid for the first two caps. 

Sweet way of doing business!!  Thank you Discount Tire!!  :)

"We came here on a Saturday afternoon. I got the veggies with homemade ranch (I love ranch). And the boytoy got a double bacon cheeseburger. He said it was absolutely amazing! And he adores cheeseburgers. So I believe him. My veggies and ranch were exactly what I wanted. Don't worry, I had French fries too. And they were so good! I like to pretend I'm healthy while I drink excessively... haha... so the beer was cold, the food we had was great, and the service and atmosphere were great! We will be back for sure. Ps. They brought our beers in about 15 seconds? It was amazing!",5,IzvDDyteNg3LCHYtIn-YmQ

"They took out the Sanrio store!!!! :/

I used to frequent this mall when I lived in this area in high school. It has a good selection of stores and recently has had some more upscale retailers join in. 

There is now a Coach store as well as a Guess store. They also have the usuals like Forever 21, Foot Locker etc.

This is a nice clean mall with a great selection of stores. Hellz yeah I'll be back anytime I'm in town.",4,nNaIwJKr7MwuyuN___W64w
"Even though this is a chain I would say that it is one of our top places to eat in CLT. The prices are on the high end but we just keep going back because the food is so good. If you go right after work you can get a great spot on the patio. Our favorite dishes are the spicy eggplant/shrimp appetizer and the beef carpaccio. The eggplant/shrimp dish is scrumptious; it has a very yummy sauce and the carpaccio is HUGE, especially for an appetizer. It comes out in the biggest plate you will ever see and has a tasty salad, flatbread slices and capers on top to make it even better. If you sign up for their rewards card/app, they send a lot of promotions to lessen the pain of the bills. Almost every time I have been in we were able to get at least $10 off by using these offers.",5,-UoxVDQM50BbV4fo2Na1-Q
"All I can say is yuck. My husband and I always check Yelp for reviews before we go to a new place. We ordered carry out Teriyaki Salmon, Chicken Katsu and a side of Edamame. The food was hot but there was barely any sauce on our entrees and it was bland. The Edamame was so small, maybe 2 beans per pod. We asked for chili sauce and had to pay a dollar for 4 tiny plastic cups. I will never go back again",1,s36un9RWud2E2p1MopqpGw
"Holy delicious !! 
If you are trying to eat clean, but are craving bad foods... EAT HERE ! 

Zoe's food is so fresh and is seasoned perfectly that it tastes like a cheat meal.

"My favorite place in the valley for Calzones the size of your head! Their water filtration system Ph balances the water to be the same as New York City so the dough rises and tastes great.

I really enjoyed the deep dish pizza and as a New Yorker it's a little hard to say but it was really good.  Also had chicken wings and fingers and they were just as good.  We will be back many times to come!,5,goVx5zY_c_wfXp3n9plZ3Q
"I would absolutely recommend this place to and pierogi lover out there. The place is a small little thing but their menu certainly packs a punch. You get the option of having your pierogoes boiled or fried (I got mine fried of course) and then all the fixings on top. Very very good, im eastern European I know a good pierogi when i see one. They do also have a sweet pierogi on the menu which I absolutely have to go back and try! 
One last thing, the restaurant shares a bathroom with the place next door. The bathrooms were really clean, and well stocked.",4,N1oa8huo4lAG0BmKSmtK_w
We recently purchased a new home and we only moved a mile away from our old house. Our sewer company changed from city of surprise to Epcor. Our bill with city of surprise was no more then $29. Our new sewer charges with Epcor water are officially now $89.33 that is not including what they are charging us for our regular water services. What a rip off this company is. If you are moving into an area they service beware. Make sure make sure to do your research on the costs they charge.,1,RaRgRutUIIuBVy5Mubej6w

Be prepared to pay at least  15% tip. It's mandatory because the manager himself will ask you for it if you don't pay it with the bill. Yes its been the same case with me twice now. Even if you get a bad service...they will beg you to pay up. Since the manager or the general manager won't pay his employees well enough.,1,Ol7RwiW3LJtEoXAwjEvvPw

"This was the best crab I have ever had. I'm a wimp when it comes to spice and I got the Louisiana flavoring with ""Baby Spice"" and it was amazing!

"I'm giving this 4 stars, but I believe this will become a 5 star review and quite possilby the best restaurant in Madison in due time. 

I went after it was open for only 4 days, and my meal was excellent but not quite perfect. I am pretty picky at expensive restaurants, and none of the minor flaws were things that would prevent me from returning. I had the hamachi crudo with crispy potatoes -- if each bite had a little of every garnish (especially the tiny lightly spicy pepper) it was delicate and delicious. But if the bite missed any of the many small elements on the dish, then it lacked seasoning. I also had manila clams which were delicious, light with a wonderful broth -- but there was a little grit in the broth. And I also had a half order of agnolotti with a pea sauce with shaved truffles. The flavor was absolutely out of this world, but it arrived at the same time as the clams, and the truffle was too strong to eat alongside the light clams.The housemade pasta was a little TOO al dente for my taste, but I understand that many chefs believe in leaving a ""bite"" to noodles and risotto that isn't to my taste. I was concerned the pasta would get cold if I ate it last, but it was just fine. So, a small plate, an antipasti and a 1/2 primi plus a nice glass of white wine ran me $70 with tip. So not cheap -- but a very elegant room and a really interesting menu. I am eager to go back and try several other items on the menu",4,zEqnvpzRt1LSCdtIqtbgyA
"One thing: half price Angelo's pizzas on Mondays! Which means you can hang out in a chill bar, drink some good beer and avoid the chaos (but still get the pizza!) 

We've always had great service and they've always had a pretty interesting mix of drafts! It seems like an especially cozy winter bar -- dark wood, friendly people and locals. 

It's become one of our go-to places every Monday.",4,_wbuxcqcUYgTEHfgE_05LA
"No matter which Mad Mex location you visit you are going to have a good meal and leave happy and full.  My favorites are the fried tofu appetizer, the shrimp and spinach quesadilla or one of the AMAZING burritos.  

Mad Mex is high on the cool factor.  Their food is reasonably priced and well made.  Their bar is stocked with great craft brews, including local fare like the East End Brewery, and they make some decent margaritas.  Their margarita of the month right now is an apple cider margarita with the rim sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon.  Come on, can you get more amazing than that?",5,570ai1BPVJUnDDDriBviNw

"I've been at this establishment several times and the host staff always greets us promptly and is very courteous. Wait staff varies on attentiveness; however, the food is great! You get a salad or soup with your meal. Prior to your meal they serve you hot ciabatta rolls with whipped butter. The caesar salad dressing is made perfect- with just the right anchovies. The prime rib is always tasty- perfectly cooked and seasoned well. They offer pure horseradish and less spicy horseradish sauce. On the side, you have a choice of potato or vegetables. The price of the meal between 3 of us was under $60 without tip. It's a great value. Keep in mind i've had prime rib at Lawry's and Prime Rib Loft is better.",5,Nwq-0CaRq0ccHtfkN9FCVg

"Nice hotel. Only downside is the machines took my money! LOL. Great restaurants for comfort food. Didn't really utilize much of the hotel other than the casino but saw signs that they have a bowling alley, a theater, an arcade, etc. I love that this is a Sam Boyd casino. Many locals from Hawaii like myself flock to these casinos. This is a favorite because it's really close to the new strip. Only about a $7 Uber ride from the Mandalay. The Uber driver also said that Orleans is the venue for all that feel good music. I saw that The Temptations will be there. If I was still here I'd for sure go.",4,KiInegjJFVlV3SrnwNbn_g
"This place's interior is modern and new but, the food is very much lacking. It's Asian fusion and the menu is limited. The workers have to dress in tacky and offensive uniforms. The food was mediocre at best. The noodles in my mom's miso ramen weren't the correct ones. The soups are very sweet and it's not flavorful. My grandpa ordered one cup of tea and they brought each of the people at the table a pot of tea. Each is $5 per pot of tea. The only thing good were the fish tacos.",2,oIGCnzGn9QxXIVN8dg0Caw
The roti here are an addiction which I indulge in at least once a week.  Unfortunately this is spoiled by the extremely poor table service which has gotten worse lately.   Several times I have sat for almost a half hour before anyone shows up at the table with a menu.  Once they do the meal comes quickly but then no one comes to the table to clear it or to ask if you want dessert or anything else.   Even though I have been a regular customer since they opened I often feel like I am wasting their time by wanting to eat in.  The good staff they had have all left.,2,bVE1KK_YrJQlFNP1Vo5gWQ
I'm very disappointed We came here 3 years ago spent 500 dollars had the time of our lives we decided to try them again made our reservations very excited for our New Years plans. We ended up sick as a Dog Throwing up ETC on our New Years Eve Party ended the night sick as a dog in our room ruined our New Years Eve. Went to talk to the manger the next day instead of helping us sent us to security ( WHY ) made me feel like he didn't believe us we had to fill out a bunch of paperwork and no answers from management Do Not Go here there are a lot of places in LV enjoy elsewhere,1,gAmW2R5UyGxta-cZHQyW1A

"Food was really god but the terrible service took away from enjoying it. We ordered four waters, got one right away and two right before the bill was dropped off, the fourth never came. Our food came out wrong and no one checked on us so it didn't get fixed. When they would drop off extra plates or waters they just slammed it on the table in front of us without saying a word, and walked away. 

Also, don't sit on the patio. We were pooped on three times from birds in the tree shading the patio. 

I'm a waitress myself so I pride myself on being very polite to wait staff. This being said, there was no reason for them to be so rude to us.",1,Ur_yN7l4I2_dbUWZFFvx5g

"I went in with high expectations of a unique attraction.
In some ways they were met and in others they fell short although perhaps as they work out the kinks things will improve.

The good - an interesting array of pettable and viewable creatures from clown fish to sea horses, sting rays to sharks.  you can feed and pet the sharks, rays and some of the bigger fish. There are also some birds and snakes.  It is very interesting and there are nine different feeding stations.  We bought a season pass but if you want to feed, you have to buy feed tokens for extra. Still, it is pretty affordable.

The kinks - very little signage exists explaining the exhibits.  Several glass enclosures had no descriptions.  I really hoped it would include more information about the creatures.

Also, it is very difficult to see some of the creatures due to the opacity of the water, unless they swim right by.

Finally, it has only been open just over a month but some of the exhibits are empty.

I hope they fix these problems because this is a great experience for the kids and adults alike.",3,6DTX4p284_o_k2n21hadlQ

"The best I can do is 2.5 stars after two visits. Not bad... Not great - just average (and a little pricey for average).

I'm a huge fan of the two main Chase restaurants and return regularly. I had high expectations for Fin as I hoped it would serve as a new work lunch stop. Sadly... It disappoints.

First I had the grilled Mahi Mahi sandwich. These trendy black buns appear to be all the rage in Japan but they are incredibly dry and tasteless. A McDonalds bun would be tastier.  The fish was good and fresh. That said, I prefer the grilled Mahi Mahi at Buster's Sea Cove in the Market. Equally fresh but a bigger portion and a few bucks cheaper. 

I also tried the Seared Tuna - same story as the Mahi Mahi. Salads are not bad but are served with too much dressing. I recommend asking for it on the side. 

Portions are on the small side and your fish, side and a drink will cost $20. 

Service was good but the lunch crowd was light on both my visits. Your food is ready in about 5-7 minutes. They have a number of bar tables to eat on but not a chair / bar stool in sight. And the heat is blasting. Not very enjoyable to eat in the restaurant. 

No real reason to make this a destination for lunch / dinner. I will stick with the main two restaurants. Not sure Fin will have long term success. I'm sure I represent their exact target market but they missed the mark in my opinion.

"I heard a lot of mixed reviews from friends and from yelp but went to check it out last week and had an great time! 
We showed up at 7 on a Saturday, so we expected a wait, but we found a seat at the huge indoor/outdoor bar and had a few drinks while we waited.
We loved the atmosphere and long tables & bench seating, other people were eating outside too. A band started playing at 9; the servers were very relaxed and casual but had great menu knowledge!! (which I always a good sign)
SIDEBAR: they have a waiter who looks like a cross between Ricky Martin and The Situation.
of COURSE we tried the pretzel fondue. Awesome. As well as the olives appetizer. I had the ahi tuna salad which was large and filling and my boyfriend had the ribs which he oogled they were better than Banderas haha.
All in all, great time, will return!!",4,yltVG33C2a1L1IH0FIWUTA
"This pizza joint came highly recommended by two coworkers of mine, so I decided to give it a whirl and ordered it for delivery.

Toppings were copious and cheese was plentiful but the pizza was very soggy and the toppings fell off in large chunks. The closest comparison would be a grocery store made pizza which you have to take home and bake yourself. The pizza crust was thick like texas toast and the sauce was absent of flavour.

My coworker demanded I give it a second try, so he brought left over pizza to the office. I warmed up my slice in the toaster oven and chowed down. The pizza was less soggy this time but I felt like it was inferior to frozen pizza. 

Don't think I'll be eating here again.",2,tmPDe2ZtLpVUsdJUnYWeUQ
First time ordering from here but it won't be the last. We got the Hawaiian thin crust pizza and it was awesome. Real cheese and quality ingredients made for a very tasty pizza.

"Sky Van Liens give me A Good price. We have a lot of heavy and out sized items and they were all moved carefully and without doing any damage. On both jobs, the on site estimates provided before the move were spittoon. I've had the misfortune of using other movers in the past. Other movers have misrepresented costs, exerted heavy pressure for additional monies or tips, were not onetime, and couldn't communicate clearly due to language differences. In my book, it's worth a lot to put those bad experiences behind me.  Thank you Sky Van Lines for a good experience.",5,WzhRgDm0nbHyMGpFLzbw6g
Amazing food and service. We went to Joes for a wedding reception. First class the entire time. The bartender was awesome. The food was so wonderful. The best food at Caesars we have had.

"Lengthy line, would be nice if they took reservations.  The wait wouldn't not have bothered me if the food had lived up to the expectations we had for it.  This was the least favorite of the three Gordon Ramsay restaurants we went to on our recent trip.  We sat at the kitchen counter and it was fun to watch the staff work although it took a bit longer to get drink refills etc, even though we were passed by several waiters who were moving right past us. Christina Wilson was working the day we were there so that was a plus as we are huge Hell's Kitchen fans.  The manager Scott stopped by to see how we were doing, which was a nice touch.  My favorite part of the meal was the sticky toffee push up pops.  Those were divine.",4,rW9UDXT5Up9z5-gtv9_HPg
I'm really sad because I had high hopes for this place the two times I went. I went when they were bt's and now as American burger.

"On our way to Lake Las Vegas and decided to Yelp for a good brunch place in the area and we ended up here... BEST DECISION EVER. 

Located in a corner of a little strip mall, interior is fun, bright, and colorful. Servers are in PJ's (must be nice!) LOL. Cool upside down umbrellas on the ceilings. They sell some pretty fun merch like shirts with witty sayings, socks and different kinds of stress balls. 

Let's talk food... First of all, you can't leave this place without trying their CUP-O-BREAD. Tastes like a cross of a cinnabon with a brioche bun, baked into a cup with cream cheese dipping sauce. I made the mistake of sharing. I would've devoured one... or two by myself. Steak and eggs, yes. Perfectly charred and seasoned on the outside but medium rare goodness on the inside. Tender, juicy, and flavorful. The chicken and waffles was okay. Big enough to split between two. Forgot what the name of the vegetarian everything bagel sandwich was, but it was good. The loco moco with spam... so delicious and big enough to split. 

Service was exceptional. Special thanks to our server, Maria. She took good care of us. Thank you! We will definitely be back when we're in the area.",5,HJeHOJjjf2ke-dreFpBy_g

Diavola - Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil 

The server was cool and pointed out that we had just ordered 2 white pizzas. He suggested we could ad tomato sauce to the Diaviola which ended up being pretty tasty. 

Then we couldn't resist and ended up ordering 3 desserts. 

They have 12 pizzas to choose from, all looked pretty damn good. I am also a huge fan of the thin crust.

"I have two words for you: pi-zookie

In certain situations there is nothing you crave more than a good BJs. Another review compared it to Chilis and that comparison is probably pretty apt but I think of it more as a cheese cake factory- they don't really specialize in anything (food wise)-they have an enormous menu with a bunch of diverse options, none of which knock your socks off but all of which are passable.BJs is a great compromise spot when trying to negotiate a meal with a large group- it has something for everyone .


All that being said we all know what we really love about BJs- the pizookie. If it wasn't for this dessert no one would have heard of this restaurant/it would of gone the way of the dodo. The pizookie is a skillet cookie Sunday that you can get in a bunch of different flavors- both cookie and ice cream. They even have a sampler pizookie that comes with 3 different cookie and ice cream combinations so you can get a variety. However, for the discerning foodie the only real option is the white chocolate macadamia nut one- the cookie comes not quite baked through, very soft and gooey in the middle. This means the white chocolate will be basically molten (be careful you don't burn 1/2 your face off Harvey Dent style by shoveling it in too fast... I know from experience) and though the whole cookie itself is soft the nuts will give you that crunch for textural contrast that is so key. 

In closing- PI ZOOKIE MOFO",3,yKqhiz0A9QPeDdmaBCoiCw

"You had me at jalapeño coffee BBQ sauce.  Their new chef has a brand new kitchen, complete with a bad ass rotisserie smoker.  I was there nosing around and he was smoking pork butts, sausage and ribs.  They offer Mason jars, that you can layer your own sides and proteins.  So you can do traditional BBQ, slaw and baked beans, or anything your heart desires!!  I saw one with mac&cheese, pork with jalapeños on top! ROAR!!!!!

When it comes to Southern sides, usually I like mine better and his slaw, baked beans and mac&cheese were delicious --- either just as good or when it came to the mac&cheese, I liked his better!!

And the bar specializes in Moonshine!  The blueberry lemonade is super dangerous.  In a good way. Kind of like a bad boy, you know you need to go home, but you end up with your panties around your ankles yelling, ""blueberry lemonade!!!!!!!!!!!""

"Excellent service, fun Team Trivia nights, a happening sports bar. 

Location: Off 36th St and Indian school. Parking is OK but sometimes when crowded, like on a Friday night, it's impossible to find a spot near the bar.  

Food: The bar serves kind of typical bar food, like nachos, hot dogs, big pretzels, and sandwiches. There are other options as well. The pretzel is tasty, but I haven't tried much else. There are other fried apps as well.  

Drinks: I order the cider, and you can order pitchers of cider too.  There are beers and cocktails as well. 

Service:  A+  The servers here are friendly, timely and helpful. I have been going to Team Trivia here for over six years, and some of the same servers are still here. They will do separate bills, come check up on our table multiple times, and refill drinks constantly.  

Ambiance: This is a typical sports bar and they host Team Trivia Weds, Thurs and Fri nights. It's free, and your team can win gift cards to use for food/drinks!  Get there early, or your team may not get a table.",4,-pytd-00a9RBq036J71rYw

I have to say my sandwich is amazing. I got the club sub meal and added jalapenos and instead of mayo did the chipotle. SO GOOD. I will definitely be eating here again.,5,zD-h6WluHwx_H6jr_LkeNw
"Let's keep up the 5 star rating! Fresh & tasty sandwiches. Sandwich, soup or chips & large drink for $7.50/$8.00:) Wow...finally another fast food sandwich place with many different varieties..my favorite is the meatball sandwich! Love the grilled cheese too. Friendly service, you just know the food is made with love & they are happy to make it for you:) Id rather give my $ to small businesses & watch them grow. You will have a pleasant experience & be happy with amount of FRESH food you get for $. Enjoy!",5,EnwINUOmACOme5EDuHx_cA
"This was one of our favorite eating experiences ever! The food, atmosphere, service and special attention from the manager was incredible. There aren't enough stars for this place.",5,5vUikzRhmPZyacOM5DR4VQ
"Union Chicken, it was good, it wasn't anything special though. 

I had the spicy chicken plate - whatever its called  - With a poutine. 
It was good, the chicken was spicy and crispy, the gravy on the poutine different but nice. They were however a little light on the cheese curds. 

There was nothing bad about union chicken, it just wasn't amazing .

Would I recommend? Sure if you REALLY want fried chicken. Will I be back? I'm going to say no, but crazier things have happened. 

Union Chicken. It was good, but not anything special...especially for the price.",3,owFVi4Y7RNwL3QuCeqHDXw
"A buddy had been recommending this place for a while and after getting a ridiculous diagnosis and quote from Airpark Jeep, I called Dave to get his thoughts.  He is an extremely knowledgeable, down to earth and a genuinely nice guy.  He went over all the things that the dealership told me I needed and broke them down into things I needed to do, things I should think about doing, and things that were completely unnecessary.  His prices were half of what the dealership would have charged and I have so much more confidence in the repairs as well.

In a world where it is hard to find someone that is not out to get you for as much as they can, it is refreshing to deal with an honest company that is really looking out for your best interests.  I can't recommend Dave and Advanced Autoworks enough.",5,k2Xa07jjllhEzsb1EPmO2g
"I am very happy with a recent visit to this Ray's location.  I was craving a meatball sub for dinner and decided to try Ray's.  There are so many options in my area for pizza/pasta/subs and I'm glad I went to Rays.  The girl at the counter was super nice and my food came out relatively quick.  I ordered a meatball parm and a Coors Lite.  My sub was hot and flavorful.  The sauce, cheese, and roll were all on point.  The meatballs themselves were nicely seasoned and had good texture.  After finishing my sub, I decided to be a fatty and ordered a slice and another beer.  They ran out of slices and had to make a fresh pie.  No complaints on my end, I'm happy to wait a few minutes longer for a fresh slice.  I will definitely be back in very soon.",5,zHN4xWUDGmdUDIRnCgkJEA
"Update: Management called to appologize for all th RATS running around and said he'd send me a coupon for our next visit. It never came. Surprised? Not really.
    
RATS!!! The wife and I stopped for quatro de Mayo and were halfway through our Quesadilla when I looked to my left and a BIG rat was sitting under the table next to us. As soon as i made a gesture towards him he ran back into the outdoor stainless bar/storage or whatever it is. OK, she was freaked out but I said, ""hey, we're on the patio so &%#$ happens and told the waitress when she came back who was also a bit freaked out especially when I told her how big it was. This was no freakin' mouse. A few minutes later our food came out and as we were engaged in the act of eating... here came another big freaking rat who ran right under our table and out hole in the wall. I once again told the server who was a bit freaked out and started looking around as she went back to wherever she came from. Never did any management staff come out to apologize or maybe offer to move us or something so we finished most of our meal and hit the road. I've been frequenting Macayo's for years but this and the fact that the food quality isn't consistent has ensured we won't frequent this establishment any time soon. We also planm to let everyone we know about this. I've lived here all my life so that's quite a few people",1,ZSn9urGiOdv60VfZQTWqkA
"I can't comment on the food yet because I have been waiting for at least 20 mins, not even counting the waiting time (another 10 mins). We were standing at the door, I'm sure the waitresses saw us but not greeting us.",1,TMY6HRaCQnqUljsnNlj_TQ
"I've often found fault with myself in raising expectations of restaurants that get mostly 5 star reviews pre-visit.   It's so difficult for any experience to match the one I can create in my head while reading everyone eloquently explaining the meaning of life found in a piece of beef tongue.  Oddly enough I had the opposite experience with Yuzu.   Despite it's high marks thus far on here, the reviewers that I know and love (okay, I'm talking Elite here) for the most part gave it a measly 4 stars.   Bah, why even bother?   It's a sad state of affairs when even a 4 star review isn't enough to get my juices flowing.   Well here it was, 9pm on a Friday night and wanting something quick and close to the house to grab a bite.  

From the moment I walked in the door I had roughly 10 ""wow"" moments.  From the way they transformed what used to be a sandwich shop into a cute and quaint Japanese spot to every single dish, my mild expectations were pleasantly blown out of the water every few minutes.

I started with a simple salad.  The kind waitress was eager to explain all dishes which arrived and I found that to be a nice touch.   She explained that the dressing was homemade and made of Yuzu, which was apropos.   I know I've had yuzu dressing before and this one was tangier and tasted better than I'm used to which set it apart from the standard Japanese side salad I'm accustomed to.  Next was the Miso soup.  My version which was part of some sort of combo with one of our entrees (add $3 to any entree gets you salad, soup, and rice) did not come with Tofu, but my friend that accompanied me ordered one a la carte which comes with tofu.   Ironically enough she hates tofu and I love it, so we switched.  The tofu was fantastic, which I might be wrong in assuming is their handmade Zaru tofu.  If it was not homemade, it definitely fooled me.  At this point in most Japanese restaurants I've eaten the salad and miso soup just because they're there, but here at Yuzu they felt like important components to the meal.   

Next our entrees started arriving, and first was the Kobe Beef Aburi.  Perfectly seared and with these little garlic chips which complemented it wonderfully.  I also received my side of rice around this time and I know you'll just think I'm pulling your leg at this point, but even the rice seemed a step above.  To make sure I hadn't accidentally ingested something laced with pot on the drive over, I had my friend try it and she confirmed that it did taste better than ""just rice"".   This is a master at work in the kitchen.

Next up was one of our standard orders of Yellowtail jalapeno.  The fish melted in my mouth and the flavor was spectacular.  I did think that the jalapenos were a little too small and didn't provide the kick that I normally like, but it was still delectable.  Our last entree was the Salmon Foil Broil, which is boiled with several veggies.   Good god was this delicious.  The salmon just fell apart and had a great flavor especially when combined with the veggies it'd been broiled with.   ""Wow"" was muttered for approximately the 8th time.   

I decided I had to have the yuzu sorbet because at this point I was convinced everything was going to taste munchies-esque good.   I was right!   Being lactose intolerant I cannot resist sorbet, and the yuzu flavor was perfect.   The waitress also brought out a complimentary order of their soy milk pudding.  I'm not a huge fan of soy milk, but this one was light enough in the soy flavor and  topped with whipped cream which always helps.   I enjoyed it even though I had to pop a lactaid pill to do so.   

The final wow was brought on by the arrival of the bill.   All those fantastic dishes came out to a total of $48 or so after tax.   I even had to do the obligatory ""on the strip that would have cost $100 and been worth every penny"" comment.",4,jWZL9aWKAUmwenaKXu39LQ
This is the worst pizza store in Charlotte. I have ordered from this location three times and they have never gotten my order correct. Ever. As the other reviewers noted the management is horrible and rude. Don't waste your money.,1,pBQxUOG-nkwUp1S8nTTwEw
"If I could give Steve 10 stars, I would. I called him at 11pm to schedule a 4:30am pickup the next morning. Though it was really a last minute thing, Steve was polite and professional and said he was available, took down my number and said he'd be there at 4:30. Now, I've taken enough taxis in Chicago to know that often, especially with big taxi companies, taxis aren't there to pick you up when they say they will. I wasn't sure - would he show up on time? Would he show up at all? 4:30 is pretty early in the morning. If he didn't show, or was late, I was going to miss my shuttle up to Midway and it was for work - I couldn't miss my flight. 

Well, I didn't have to worry. Not only did Steve show up, he was early (didn't charge me for that, of course). His taxi was incredibly clean and fresher than probably any car I've been in, including my own. Steve himself was personable as well as professional. He was also very knowledgeable about the area and knew exactly where my shuttle would arrive at the station. 

But here's what impressed me the most. We got to the shuttle stop and the shuttle hadn't arrived yet, so he stayed with me to make sure I got on the shuttle safely, at no charge for his time. He explained he wouldn't feel right dropping someone off in the dark without knowing they got to their destination or next transfer safely. Then, it turned out my shuttle was full! I asked him if he went all the way to Midway. He said yes, but that honestly to go that distance, there were some cheaper options. He actually even brainstormed with me about other options in the area! He stayed there to make sure I wouldn't be stranded, as I tried to figure out if any of those other options would work. When it turned out they wouldn't, he offer to lower his rate so that I could have one more option - it was still more expensive than Uber would have been (slightly - maybe about a total $30 difference), but I was glad to do it as by then I knew I trusted him as an individual. As a woman going all the way to Midway by myself that early in the morning, I didn't want to take my chances with some random Uber driver who might not be a safe driver or a safe person. It was a great ride there - good conversation (he's a super interesting guy and easy to talk to without being in-your-face chatty) and he's a safe driver (unlike the last Uber I took when I was traveling, that tailgated and zoomed in and out of lanes so quickly that I was sick the whole day after).  

TL;DR: Definitely go with Steve of Executive Taxi if you want to ride in a clean vehicle, with a professional, caring, conscientious driver. I was so impressed by his honesty and integrity, generosity, and caring. He is also just a really cool person to talk to if you are going on a long ride. Also, I found out talking to Steve that he basically IS Executive Taxi, so if you call you're going to get only him or, if he has an emergency and can't make it, one of two other trusted affiliates. He doesn't farm out to dozens of other taxi services, thankfully.

I'll always be thankful I went with Executive Taxi for my 4:30am travel fiasco, because he turned it into such a positive experience. Thanks again Steve for saving the day for me!",5,Y4UyTm4tOQW8fhFDamPm2A

"I love this place for so many reasons. 

1) Because it's the best drinking spot with variety and low prices near my house. Proximity is important. 
2) They have an extensive outdoor seating area so on nice evenings it is perfect. They also have some yard games. 
3) It's just a very laid back environment. The bar staff is helpful and friendly. You can bring food with you and no one is going to make a stink about it (a friend and I showed up with a pizza, not a word). 
4) To reiterate the prices you can't beat. 
5) ANNND the variety is insane. For beer they have a room temp area to choose from, and you can throw it in their chiller. Or they have a fridge of already chilled beer (smaller selection), as well as several options on tap. Then, if you're more of a wine enthusiast, they have a decent selection of wine as well. 

Everybody wins. Go here and you won't regret it.",5,28fAMmEu2vWxxlaDKeYsHg
"I don't know if the Bellagio has fallen on hard times, but I ate here about five years ago and the food was in a whole different class of where it is now. I would expect such junk as DRY stir-fry noodles over at the Excalibur buffet for $15, but for the $25 Sunday Brunch? At one of the most expensive hotels on the strip? Gross!

I suggest skipping the Bellagio buffet all together and heading over to the Wynn - a better buffet splurge (even though it's $5 or so cheaper). See my review for more info.

Looking forward to maybe plunking down the $85 for the Bally's Silver Buffet or whatever it's called on my next trip!",2,W3RMjk6DIyG8_q-Z865R4w

"First time here, recommended by a friend. Nice friendly staff, who take the time and train you, so you can be safe.
Only pet peeve was the waivers for everyone, even if you are just going to sit at the tables and watch, you have to sign the waivers which is done on an ipad and takes forever to complete.
Other that that, the place is great!! Atmosphere is good.  Kid friendly place. Nothing intimidating here, everyone gives each other space and respects others. 
From looking at the photos from other reviewers, it looks like they change the climbing rock formations once in awhile, to keep it interesting and challenging. Great idea!!!
Very happy with first visit, and happy that its kid friendly. Prepare to spend a few hours here.

"I'm a couponer, not a member of the bourgeoisie. This place is like a palace of a grocery store, with prices to match. I was able to find a couple of things that were comparable to what I am used to spending, but only a few. If you are looking for high end delicacies, they've got them. If you are looking for affordable groceries to fill your pantry with, check elsewhere. Beautiful store, just a little bit out of my price range.",4,3bJ5bTxKYfIeVqFy9JxVNw
"Rating is 4 because 
- excellent service 
- friendly 
- wait time for 2 is only about 10min and they text you when the seat is ready 
- -1 star bc it's too much for me. What's too much? It's literally heart stopper with high calorie and there's no fruit/salad. Better, cheese, mayo... lots of salt.. you'd like it if you're into that kind of stuff. Not my favorite. I won't order California crepe again. Potatoes are good, again it's very salty.  


What we ordered 
- California crepe with bacon mushroom and cheese 
- banana muffin from Yelp check in 
- classic eggs Benedict 
- lemonade 
- coffee

Far superior to  other fried chicken chains (you know who they are).

"First time being here and it was obvious to most of the patrons so be prepared when you come! There was only one menu along side where the line forms so it was a bit hard to take your time making a decision. 

The crew seemed a bit lost and hectic (maybe because of busy lunch hour) but were very friendly. 

The pizza was great! A lot of options that were unique or you can build your own. The prices were a bit steep though just for a pizza. There was a $5-$8 lunch special. 

The ambiance was very trendy and the outside seating area was perfect for people watching. Although they had two TVs I wouldn't recommend for watching the big game or anything. The mood was a bit too relaxed for that. 

Overall, the pizza was good and the service was good. I would recommend it if you're looking for more trendy versus money saving meal.",4,gi_V6yb_6bGH6nWNFV1YXA
"How can one tell if sushi is the real deal and fresh? For one, tuna should be a bright red and translucent, like how red gelatin looks like. The consistency of fresh sashimi should be firm but not spongy. Fresh salmon, should glisten more. As a rule, the duller the color, the more spongy consistency; the lower the quality. Cleveland suffers from being far from the ocean. Sushi suffers a bit especially in the winter months.

With all that criteria laid out, and having had sushi in Asia as a frame of reference; Pacific East and Shuhei; have the freshest sashimi-grade fish one can find in Cleveland. I order sashimi in places like this. In lesser places I go for rolls and drown it in the sauces to compensate - not here. Sushi rock is good too -- but the quality is the same as Pacific East but at a much higher price. All the good places use authentic short-grain Japanese rice -- watch out for places that try to pull a fast one with substitutes to this kind of rice.

One of my favorite non-sushi dishes is Unagi Don and Shrimp tempura.

Sushi here can't ever be as good as sushi in coastal areas and in Asia, but I'm giving it 4 stars because, all things considered, this is the best in Cleveland.

...as for Malaysian food in a Japanese restaurant, sigh, why? OK, nothing wrong with that, but I have a thing about restaurant ""purity of theme"".",4,b0HZx2KPq3CkpItKQS8yOw

"We had a group go here after a conference.  I have to admit the food was amazing but the service was terrible!  I didn't know the type of place we were going so was not compliant with their dress code.  It was 110 degrees outside and I was in shorts.  When I was not allowed to sit with the rest of my party, I went back to my room at another hotel and changed.  I get places having dress codes but we were sitting outside and I have no idea why it was so strict.  The girl who ""talked"" to me was rude and condescending.  I'm sure if I looked like I had a bunch of money, she would have let me be seated with the rest of my group. 

That being said, when I got back after changing, we ordered and the food was amazing.  It was one of the best cooked steaks I've had.  The ""show"" entertainment out in the pond was interesting.  I'm pretty sure I saw a red giant ball and a blue giant ball have sex and produce a little purple ball.  I have no idea who comes up with this stuff but we were laughing a lot at the shows every thirty minutes or so.

So for food, 5 stars.  Service 1 or 2.  Gets me to this average.",3,pKAAZk4rdGzvVgcSTPo-WA
"I ate here for the first time last night. Me and friends came in around 530 and were the first customers. Customer service was prompt and attentive. The chef even threw in some delicious fried chicken skins. We were the only customers for a good 30-45 so I can't comment what service would be like during a full house.

The was pretty good. We had the okonomiyaki (pancakes), shumai dumplings, fried oysters, and delicious takoyaki octopus balls!
We also had the Tonkontsu Ramen, lamb skewers, and pork sandwiches for the main course. Ramen was pretty standard when compared to other quality Japanese ramen shops. 

I'd come again to try the other skewers.

My daughter had an appointment scheduled for Monday at 9am. When we arrived the office was unlocked but no one was there. We waited for 25 minutes and finally when the alarm company came they told us it was closed. Really I was given an appointment 7 months prior. So we called and the girl on the other line told me she had no record of my daughter and proceeded to hang up. When we got home 2 hrs later received two calls from the office to apologize that there was a communication problem that their dentist was not coming in so the office was closed. Never received a call regarding the closure. To add insult to injury the girl who hung up on me called to say she was sorry. Never going back.

 I ordered another dark and stormy (as I did on my previous visit) but this time it came in a BIGGER glass and was just as strong as it was in the little glass :) and I was driving. So when she came back and asked how the drink was I told her it was good but a bit strong. She made a joke about her drinks being too strong, then brought me the remaining (almost full) can of ginger beer so I could dilute it, which was quite nice.

"Looking around Yelp for something special in the area while traveling and my family and I enjoyed the photos and reviews for this spot, so we stopped in for dinner. Not sure why, but we had an awful experiance. Was extremely disappointed with the staff, quality of the food and experience overall.

Family of six and no one enjoyed their meal and said we should have gone to Del Taco after eating here. 

I ordered the ribeye tacos and they looked good, but the meat tasted awful, was super thin and cut up into very small chunks with a bad taste to it and even the tortilla tasted bad.  The fresh avocado was a nice touch, but this dish was a total fail!

My wife went with a mix of tacos. She said the barbacoa was very oily and could have used salt, chicken was very peppery and tasted like it came out of a bag and like be hated the ribeye.

The kids meals that come with a drink and side which is cool. We got quesadillas and unfortunately they were not good. The kids did not eat them and said they tasted bad. Sampling them to see what was up, my wife and I both agreed they were super super salty. $7 x 2 fail on the kids meals.

My son got $10 nachos with no sour cream.  Then when it came it had no beans and sour cream and when I told them that this was not what context (very politely) they argued with me and said I never said no sour cream and I said no beans. My son and I both were pretty clear at the register no sour and perhaps they heard no beans. The nachos were awful! The cheese wiz with peppery chicken that tasted like it was pulled out of a bag. The chips were very greasy and really did not work for nachos. This was an epic fail and I am very surprised this place has such good reviews considering everything we had was bad.",1,5pcpr185BZh7X8BRGIzX7g

Called back and same thing (yes, checked the phone number, etc.  This is the THIRD time we have had problems at this KFC. Sadly, it seems as if this store is poorly managed and the help they hire isn't worth the minimum wage they are probably being paid. They are surly, rude, and dumb as sticks on top of it all. Avoid this KFC like the plague if you want my advice. There are newer and far cleaner stores in Mesa and Tempe and Gilbert that actually have well trained and polite and helpful staff. Too bad this isn't one of them! Who ever owns/manages this mess of a store ought to be ashamed of the lousy service, rude help and fairly dirty store! Do not go here even if you're starving!",1,AZLer0LYZAsdcG99H1G3Xw
"The food here is really good and they have some awesome deals Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday with Tacos, wings and pirogies. The nachos are also very good and so is the pizza. My only comment would be that the service is very slow and although the service when available is good, it is few and far in between. Would still recommend for good food and good times.",4,avVzDnjAULLIKdTt6kP4kQ
"We have been here a few times in the last month. Unfortunately, there is no consistency in the quality of food or service. When we were there Saturday night my husband and father ordered the beef skewers. The meat was not cut against the grain so was extremely chewy...basically inedible. The same issue with the meat in my son's steak rolls and nephews dish. The vegetables were burnt on several of our plates. There were 9 of us and 6 people got the their food after 30-40 minutes. The other three half an hour after that. The majority of our party was done eating. The hummus trio is very good as was the bread. Even with that caveat, I don't think we will be back.",1,1fsRS7bDKLWJmYRQNnzPlg
"Having recently found Khao Soi, which is a curry-like dish served with egg noodles, lime and crunchy noodles on top, I have been on a mission to try the same dish in as many places as possible. Khao San Road was next.

The restaurant itself is quite small and the wait can be long, but the hostess is super friendly and the line moves fast. Once at your table, the menu itself is very simple and everything tastes great. The restaurant itself is quite noisy and during the summer, the shutters at the front are open which gives the place a nice airy ambiance.

The Khao Soi (see above) is excellent and can be ordered to your preferred spice level. We also tried the squash fritters which were very tasty.

The bill was about $40 for two mains and a shared starter which is expensive enough, but it's worth it.

A must try if you are in the Theatre District for a show or going to see a movie at Scotiabank Theatre!",4,0jf1I7YQJiQaeFnpbaaX-w
"Went in to get my button repaired on my iPhone 5 and picked it up and the person who fixed it got dirt trapped throughout the screen. 6 pieces big enough to count, more that are just pieces throughout that are tiny. I wasn't even told when it got picked up. On top of that I asked him to fix it and was told that he would most likely break the screen trying to fix it and that he wouldn't warrant the repair of the screen broke. I will be calling manager and update Yelp post upon his response. I have never had such poor customer service. They just ruined a $600 phone. I could have replaced the button myself and just didn't want to. Hopefully manager fixes and I can update post. Extremely disappointed in the service received.",1,sK8-z6OI7Cio93GCzGzWyQ
"I was really craving this place when I last visited Las Vegas! Specifically, I was craving the bacon wrapped dates and sangria. I was so disappointed when I heard about the health code issues at the Henderson location, so I was happy to see that this location was good to go. 

We ordered a plethora of dishes, all of which were very delicious! However, they are so overpriced that it was hard to make sure the small party I was with got even a taste of each dish. Some of the small dishes had only 2 pieces! For $10-ish dollars, I think that's a bit ridiculous. I simply couldn't afford to eat here with more than one or two people, because that adds up quickly. 

I love the interior of this restaurant. It is a pleasant place to be! I especially love the patio, although it was closed the last time I was there. 

Overall, this would be a good restaurant for a date, but, in my and my wallets opinion, not so great for a party of multiple people because you would need multiple plates of the same item. The bacon covered dates and sangria are must haves.",3,uOZdYaEey9bDkSf0YkGHPg
My go to for good thai in SW vegas. I really enjoy the pad thai so much. I think when I first found this place I ordered it 3x a week for a month! They have some really hearty authentic thai dishes on the menu. I absolutely cannot come te an order though without adding on some thai egg rolls. The sauce that comes with them is addicting I could put that stuff on anything and eat it!,5,u-R-qO3a0asK0JIJGV4AXQ
"Desperately needed a trim and thought I would check this place out since they had good reviews! Walked right in on a Saturday morning and got my hair cut on the spot by Heather. She was so sweet and did a great job! I was nervous/skeptical about getting a $14 hair cut, but it was exactly what I wanted and for a great price! I will be going back for sure, might even get color next time.",5,rcTwZvnZ8YMpo1Gc0PRAOg
"I really enjoyed the Stockyards Restaurant. It's a vintage steakhouse located in the area where the old Phoenix Stockyards used to be. The atmosphere is classic. Dark wood, heavily padded booths, a magnificent bar. I love the places that have the ""wedge"" salad, and the one at the Stockyards is very good. My steak was cooked perfectly, and was also very good. I had the whiskey mashed sweet potatoes as my side, and they were a treat. I went on a Monday night, and it was very busy. But the service was excellent.

It's a bit pricey, but sometimes you've just got the urge for a good steak, and deserve to spoil yourself.",4,zVqtkGHlr6Lxw-CTBvF7uA
"I hate buying shoes, I really hate it. I buy one pair, wear them until they fall apart and then grudgingly go buy another pair. One of the reasons I dislike buying shoes is the difficulty in finding shoes to fit my flintstone like feet. Most shoe companies decided that they would rather make the public with broad feet either wear clown or elf shoes instead of making things that fit.

Well, if you can stop a stone wheeled car with your bare feet, then otherwides is for you! I stopped in and caught their big sale. I walked out with three pairs of shoes, and my wife got a lovely pair of boots. They are of great quality. I am now a fan, and will be back when these fall apart!

Thank you.",5,DFX0NvHQ6WgQ0kM_XgY7Wg
Super impressed with this company! Called last minute for service 2 days before Christmas and they squoze me in AND did not skimp on the service! They went the extra mile to detail my escalade I had just repossessed back from a friend who couldn't make the payments.... it was GROSS!! They didn't complain at all though and got right to work with a smile to get it ready for my parents to drive when they got in town for Christmas.... I'm sure it took way longer than expected but they didnt cut any corners and worked into the dark evening! I'm sure my tip wasn't enough to compensate so I wanted to give them a shout out on here.... thanks Shineworks!!,5,VUWonMWPCj4u5c9yJc-CTg

"The ribs were mediocre for the price but to be fair they were sold out of everything else which says a lot for what they didn't have. What they did have was the ribs which again, were OK... 

I will go back to try the brisket since it seems to be a hit with yelpers. 

I'll say that we also had their Mac n Cheese which was pretty awesome! I rarely order Mac n Cheese (my wife ordered it) but I was not disappointed in any way about it. 

I will update when I get back because it was worth trying again. If there's any brisket left by the time I get there...

Good for a switch from the rib chains.",4,ILzdgklzsA8auWeedzP4lw

"My girlfriend and I have been going to Baja for happy hour for well over a year now and we'll continue to go--we've never left disappointed!

The carnitas, chicken, and fish tacos are all great, but we're completely hooked on the potato tacos. I know it sounds weird, but their seasoned hash brown style potatoes make for awesome tacos. 

They run daily specials often, we're so hooked on the cheap beer and dollar tacos that we rarely stray, but I've never seen anyone order anything that doesn't look delicious.",5,LCMIgIeNq95BlLhkvgiw1w
"I went for a cheap meal since there was no dinner at home one night. Given the price I paid ($9.00) the servings were surprisingly large. In addition the food was cooked well, the chicken was soft and cooked through, the potatoes were also done well and not over or undercooked as you sometimes find fast food places do it, and finally the rice was also a similar fashion. 
I am satisfied with the service given and would come here again if I am in need of a quick meal.",4,6CEc93ySnu7Fd6g93Xi35g
"I've always had a really hard time finding a good place to get a hair cut. Maybe I'm picky but, in the past, there was pretty much only one person who was able to cut my hair the way I liked. Unfortunately the place became so busy that it was too difficult to get appointments and I ended up moving away as well.

Therefore the search for a good, relatively reasonably priced hair stylist began, and Toronto (the city I'm from) generally came up short.

I was in Cleveland for a bit on business and was in desperate need of a haircut. I decided to bite the bullet and get one before I got back to Toronto to see if I could get some luck in Cleveland. It turned out to be a great decision as it is one of the best cuts I have received so far.

I was lucky to get a same day appointment with Melissa, presumably since she had  cancellation. I would greatly recommend her for men with thick hair or asian type hair as she really knows what she is doing. I was able to tell her the general idea of what I wanted and got good input on styling recommendations.

Overall the haircut was above my expectations. Melissa did a great job and gave me exactly what I requested. For full disclosure, upon coming home I can see a couple of spots where it could have been improved but on an overall basis, I am really happy because it is clear that this cut will be able to keep its shape as it grows. Another plus: she even washed my hair after the cut saving me a shower when I got home.

If a $25-30 cut is within your budget I would strongly recommend going to Eddy's on Coventry and I would personally recommend Melissa",5,lwOdiWBjT4hPbDZe1_pDlQ
"Not great...not even good.  Ordered through the drive-thru; the first window was closed, so I drove to the second.  No menu, no idea what there is to order when the guy asks what I want.  I remember that there were fries with feta cheese and balsamic vinegar, interesting, so I order those and the guy suggests the Pep Pep.  

Now I wait.  I understand that it's freshly prepared, or so says the sign next to me, but come on if you are going to do a drive-thru the service needs to be speedy.  The order takes so long, I'm asked to pull up so the guy can get the order from the 1 car behind me.  Really?!  If it takes so long to make the micro burger and fries with goo on it how are you ever going to make a profit? 

The guy finally brings my food and I drive away.  I get home excited to try something new.  The slider is dripping grease (so much for gourmet) overly covered in some orangish sauce that tastes like Thousand Island minus the relish, the meat patty is half burned.  At least the sandwich was still warm.

Now for the fries, feta and balsamic on fries sounded like an appetizer from a super fancy restaurant.  I'd love to say they were amazing and made up for the crummy $3 slider, but when I opened my fries they were covered in the same disgusting sauce as the slider, bland caramelized onions (how these had no flavor I'm not sure), plastic cheddar cheese that had congealed beyond edible (how the cheese could be hardened and the fries still relatively hot is beyond me) and bacon.  

So sorry Slidin' Thru, no home run for you, you struck out on the first try.

No way will I try this again when a crappy meal cost over $7.",1,CXEKfXbLLc9mRlYaHsqeAg

"The food here is great! And, the customer service is top-notch. I say this, even after we had a misunderstanding with the restaurant and the front counter of the Orleans. But.... it really wasn't the restaurant's fault. Allow me to explain, we were given a food comp from The Orleans for $50. This was part of the hotel package that we received. We had put down a cash deposit for our stay... we did not use a credit card for this trip. Well, when we tried to use our food credit at the restaurant, the restaurant initially tried to charge it to the room.  After we had already departed from the restaurant, the restaurant realized that because there was no credit card on file, they could not charge it to the room so they called the front desk. An employee at the front desk who really did not know her job too well, told them that they had to figure it out so the employee of the restaurant actually called the hotel room, at 2 a.m! So both employees at this point had made mistakes, but the mistakes were each based on the fact that there are not proper procedures in place for when a guest checks in with cash as a deposit, and is receiving a comp. Eventually, after my wife spoke to a more well-versed employee at the front counter the entire situation was figured out. The restaurant, apologized for the employee calling the room at such a late hour, the restaurant offered us a free dinner for the misunderstanding, and the server actually came to our table personally, and apologized profusely.  The manager on duty was very polite and very accommodating to us. And we were very thankful to him. The Orleans needs to figure out how to set the system in place to something like this does not continue to happen because from what we were told it happens all the time!",3,B-6w06rXj6AKLpEqANAWjQ
"Only a couple times have I eaten at a highly yelp scored review, and totally disagreed with the average rating. This would be one of those cases! Between this and the new Bell's bbq up the street, this is some of the worst bbq I have ever experienced. Are the LVite's so deprived & ignorant to what great barbecue it that they feel this is good? It seems to me that before people open a restaurant it would be something they are good/great at making, and comfortable maintaining the quality for large numbers of people. These places need better brining & curing processes for taste & moisture, smoke quality & control, and knowing when to stop cooking! This is not food that is cooked to order folks, the expertise, control and cooking is supposed to be done ahead of time and reheated gently for your dining pleasure, or not. Dry, overcooked and tasteless should not be part of the process, not when your taking our hard earned dollars.",1,Db-YGbGulXGwOy281UMGkw
"We came here for something different. Wow. We even had to ask our server what is your favorite as the menu was a bit out of our norm. We got what Emily said and were not disappointed in the slightest.  Yummy shrimp appetizer with which we dipped cheese bread in the garlic sauce. Seafood stew was stupendous. The drinks are memorable- fresh and exciting. Passion fruit dessert was also memorable. We can not wait to come back and try what the table next to us ordered- none of which is the same as we got but all looks great. Casual, fun, and a place we will come back to in a second.",5,DvUhIQ-5lUSERK9KmWzRmQ

"The Greenbush Bar doesn't need a good review, or a bad one.  When you walk in, you immediately understand that this is a one of a kind space by Madison standards.  There's a sensibility to the entire place that makes you intuitively understand that you're in the right place at the right time.  Seeing the owner bussing tables and getting her hands dirty, seeing waitstaff doing their best to assist patrons and refill water glasses.  These are good signs.  The beer, wine and liquor menu covered a lot of ground, and had something for anyone.  Starters included a roasted garlic app, which had good flavor, and was a nice compliment to their in-house bread.  Another good choice was the tossed green salad, which included reggiano-parm cheese, olives and cucumber slices.  Finally, a reliable pizza topped with sausage and green peppers.  Incidentally, they give you a choice of crust thickness, and even have a gluten free crust option.  The only disappointment was a corn and leek soup, which was too brothy and had no spice profile (as in NONE).  In spite of that, I'll be back.",4,_c103Re0aIio5M-au19ZaA

"This restaurant is totally underrated. Let me just clarify that this is a top notch fine seafood cuisine, so bare this in mind before expecting a cheap meal.

The decor is absolutely gorgeous, you first walk in and you're greeted by a front receptionist. Just beside the entrance they have a massive aquarium where they hold some of the largest lobsters, crabs and fishes you have ever seen.
The bathroom is a single luxury suite equipped with mouth wash, q tips.. Etc.

Service is beyond superb, as waiters and waitresses are very friendly and attentive to your every need. They also help you separate your meal into plates and bowls for every guests. They are very efficient in cleaning our plates right when it gets full.

We had breakfast and dinner here the same day, so the prices differ extremely between the two.

Breakfast is dim sum style, we had a table of 8, and ate roughly $300 with a bag of leftovers.

The dinner comes in sets of meal that matches up with suggested serving sizes from 2 up to 12 people. The prices start at around $300 and up to $1700.
We had a set of lobster and crab meal, for 8 people, the set itself was around $800. We ordered other dishes and wine, the bill came up to be about $900. The meal was very filling and there were still lots of left overs, we ended up packing up 2 bags. 

To be honest we could probably pull off a 6 people meal set as they give a lot. 

I didn't take pics of every dishes but in our set we had, 
Sashimi platter 
Clams 
Sea cucumber 
12lb lobster 
2 crabs
Fish 
Rice
Soup 
Desert drink 
Fruit platter",5,lea-hl5STW4mk-w8P1sXGA

Just a FYI to others. I will never return.",1,8MIVmx8B5HzjhoqrH1Npgg

Their lunch special has good portion to it for $5.99 and you'll get free Thai iced tea if you ""checked in"". My friends and I have been here 3 times already.

"Chako offers an AYCE KBBQ with a modern feel. It's clean and spacious, allowing some room for ventilation, though you will go back home, smelling like your dinner. Weekend dinner comes to about $18.99. 

- Meats: There are some average to decent cuts of meat. The most memorable was the Chako Ribs (which is only available for dinner). thicker and marinated. Delicious!

- Vegetables: There's pineapples! And also zuchhini and red peppers. But pineapples! Who wouldn't be excited?

- Sushi: There are 4 choices of sushi. Average, but at least you do have the option to order it at a KBBQ.

- Seafood:  Calamari, tiliapia, shrimp and mussels.

- Side dishes: As mentioned, the kim chi is surprisingly tasty. You're also offered tofu, bean sprouts, seaweed.

Of course, order the rice. I don't know how anyone can go through all that sodium/fat without blending that taste.

Chako is a good choice for group outings, though it can get quite packed during Friday and Saturday nights. Service start to be much slower and inconsistent: multiple attempts to re-order dishes that never showed up, or to change the BBQ plate, or to clear some of the dishes away. So it can get quite frustrating.",4,pk6piZwnQ4PcRK5--M9DBg

The place was very clean and put together. They say that you get same day service, so I expected to not be able to pick my phone up for at least a day, but it was ready within an hour! My phone was as good as new! So amazed. Overall, great customer service and very quick service. I definitely would recommend this place! :)",5,StxQw0S6WDh-f_pVjaow2A
"The hype is not real with this one.

I don't get this place. Given how they advertise themselves on IG, I came in here thinking this was more of a bakery with a few drinks here and there. But nope, it's apparently the other way around. Cafe 86 is more of a boba/coffee shop with a few pastries. I don't know about you guys, but I came here to try their pastries.. and 2 out of the 3 times I have gone there, they barely had anything left. If you're going to heavily advertise your pastries everywhere on social media, maybe you should focus on having them readily available.

First visit, they had no pastries available.. and we came around 3pm. Since we were already there, we decided to go ahead and try a drink. I asked the cashier what she recommended, and she said that the Ube Monster was popular - so thats what I ordered. I guess it's supposed to be like a Ube and Cookies&Cream milkshake. I hated it. It had very little Ube flavor and just tasted like milk. The cookies weren't even throughout the whole drink. All they did was put some cookies at the bottom of the cup, and on top. Pretty lame. Super disappointing and do not recommend. 

2nd visit, they had only ube truffles available.. and we came around 5pm. We also did the Yelp check-in for a free Hibiscus Cooler. The ube truffle had good ube flavor, but the texture wasn't to my liking. My toddler ended up eating it all though. The Hibiscus Cooler was pretty terrible - it literally tasted like water. Another disappointing visit.

3rd and final visit, we came in around 11am and was finally able to try the Ube Leche Flan Cupcakes. We also ordered the Mermaid Drink with Boba (Sea Salt Green Tea), an Ube Truffle, and got the free Hibiscus Cooler again (hoping it wouldn't be watery like last time). Was super excited to try the cupcakes, since that was what this place is known for.. but was pretty let down. The cupcake was hard and dense! I felt like I was eating play-doh or something. I'm sorry, but that's not how a cupcake should be. The only saving grace was the flan, but even that was just okay. We ended up just eating the flan and tossing the ""cupcakes"" away. Both drinks we got tasted watered down yet again, and the boba had no flavor. Yet another disappointing visit.

Also, what is up with the the theme of this place? It's all over the place. It's like they just took everything they like and threw it all together, even though it makes no sense at all. Star Wars, cars, Filipino sun, mermaid drink, _____ monster drinks, zebra drink? It doesn't make sense.

Cafe 86 is just all hype. It's sad, because I love me some good pastries. Such a shame!

TL;DR - They seldom have the pastries available that they widely advertise. Pastries are not as great as everyone makes it seem, and the drinks are just bad. 

Tip: If you want their pastries, go right when they open. If you want drinks, go to Brew Tea Bar.",1,q5LB40QRTREngGhX5mGAMQ
We had dinner here. The food was mediocre at best. For an appetizer we had chef's focaccia. It was a pizza crust. Bland. The dipping sauce had vinegar mixed in like a salad dressing. It was not a good match. The rigatoni entrée was flavorful but upset my stomach. The waiter never asked how our meal was after we were served. I would not eat here again and I would not recommend it.,2,XkdJzGbFrEqQLaLlBYeTzg
"Good food; Bad Flies; So-So Service.

Tried this place with my family after the June 2012 write-up in Phoenix Magazine.  The restaurant was a little odd to find and the mandatory valet was interesting, but the interior is amazing.  The person(s) who did the building and interior design did a superb job-- the spot is very open, the revealed kitchen is fun (especially for an interested 4 year-old), and the artistic touches and lighting fit perfectly.  Not often I take notice of these kinds of things, but this is an exceptional concept place that way.

We tried the Chef's Board, Burrata Alla Panna (asparagus), Mafaldine (rock shrimp and long noodles), Margherita pizza, and buttered noodles. All were very good, though not remarkable.  Bread is for-charge and the water has an ""interesting"" taste.

The most offending thing was the flies.  We're talking lots of them.  And big ones.  And so persistent you might as well pull them up a chair and plate.  

When your little kid asks why there are so many flies an why they have red stripes and such big eyes, something went awry.  A kid should not notice the exoskeletonal features of insects at a nice restaurant.  Odd to constantly brush the flies away, just look around to see every other table doing the same.  It proved to b a sad, asynchronous dance for would-be happy diners.  We skipped dessert just to get away from the bothersome diptera.  If only the service staff was as attentive!

Waitress was middling at best.  Drinks were left unfilled for long periods.  Two plates came out too hot while the pizza was just warm-- our daughter's dish came out so hot that she would have burnt her mouth had my wife not tested first (and singed her tongue).  I also had to ask if there were specials because it wasn't volunteered... Maybe specials are a private and fabulous secret, here.  I didn't order the special soup, so not sure if it was indeed nirvana.

Would visit again if there was reason, but my wife and I agreed walking out that it wouldn't be worth a trip on its own.",4,9hCuIQ324E1yJunv3hK9lA
"Lance and Debbie at Desert Storage were amazing. They were exceptionally professional and friendly on the phone and in person. Moving is never fun but they certainly made it a lot less stressful. They took the time to explain all our options and were patient, never pushy, while we decided on the right-size storage for our needs. They even provided a move-in van free of charge saving us time and money! Desert Storage is the cleanest, most accessible storage facility (air-conditioned park-in loading bay) we've seen. Since we were storing some boxes and furniture during the Summer months we wanted a unit that was air conditioned, and after shopping around we found their prices very reasonable. I have to say it was a huge plus to be able to drive right into the air-conditioned bay and not have to unload in the heat. Also, with all of the security measures they have in place we have peace of mind knowing our possessions are safe and secure. Great experience all around.  5 stars without hesitation!",5,so-r5mmMR3z3PdGCP_1LJw

Lindsay was awesome and negotiated a discount with the manager, as well as for my bridesmaids' dresses that had already been chosen previously!

I really had a great experience here and I highly recommend :)",5,yCLqQUGJE90OW9IW4CTXTQ
"Terrible, just terrible!  What I found in this office was rampant irresponsibility, incompetence and lack of professionalism.  

I've been doing my own taxes with TT for the last 5 years.  After learning that H&R offers a second look tax review from your taxes filed the previous year, I decided to put them to the test to review my 2015 tax filing. Based on my experience, I would entrust them with my new tax filing for year 2016 since now I don't have the time to work on that.  Boy, did they fail the test.

In October 2016 I dropped off two binders corresponding to my taxes filed in 2014 and 2015.  They were supposed to check 2015 only, but the tax consultant asked me to leave also 2014 in case she needed to reference to that year to clarify something.  After two months of not hearing anything from her, I sent her an email and she informed me that she had been transferred to another office and my binders had been assigned to another agent.  The new agent never contacted me, never did anything on my taxes and when I stopped by H&R she did not know where the binders were. After some looking around, she found them.  I reported that to my original agent and she contacted the office manager about my problem.

I went online and, after reading the profiles of the agents in that office, I chose one with vast real estate experience since I own rental properties.  Subsequently, the office manager, without my consent or authorization, removed her name and re-assigned me to Claudia Melissa Argueta, now Claudia Melissa Bozic.  Being that it was a referral from the manager and she was aware of what I needed, I trusted her judgment and went along with her choice.  BAD CHOICE!

Claudia Melissa Bozic received my binders on December 2 and by the end of February 2017 she had not done the review.

On January 11, 2017, I sent her a follow up email to see how things were going with the tax review. She did not respond to my email.   Afraid that she had left the office, like the first tax consultant did, I personally went to H&R. She was there, we spoke briefly and she said that she was working on the tax review.

Not having heard anything from her, I was very disappointed about the tremendous amount of time she was taking to do a review.  I am not a tax person and I can do my taxes in a week.  On February 21, 2017, I wrote her an emailed  expressing my disappointment and requesting the return of my binders.  

The email was undeliverable.  Claudia Melissa Bozic had changed her email address and didn't have the courtesy of notifying me. She was the one who said when I met her that she preferred communication via email.

I needed my binders urgently since I was in the process of refinancing one of my properties and the bank needed my tax documents.  I called H&R and Claudia Melissa Bozic was in California and no one could find my binders in the office.

I requested to speak with the office manager and they finally found my binders after much inconvenience caused to me.

In summary, since October 2016 to February 2017, this office did NOTHING.  Just wasted my time and caused aggravation that I didn't need.  It's a free service, ok, but if they are not going to do the job, please do not offer the service and disrespect people's time.

Due to my bad experience, I do not recommend H&R Block.",1,ABhuao8bD6_jF4vBvuhHxA
"Meatballs look and taste like Fancy Feast cat food....Seriously they are NOT home-made. Marinara sauce straight from the can with no additions, tasted like watery flavorless acidy tomatoes. Pizza was undercooked and had to request them to cook it for another 20 minutes. Who wants droopy pizza that cannot stand up by itself....really? The baked rigatoni was the star of the show earning 3 stars out of 5 for being the least messed up, and having some good flavors. Will not be returning here again, unless I hear things have changed for the better. You could tell that there were no owners or mangers present. It was a millennial duo cook-off - the only thing missing was the microwave and the frozen burritos.

"I was excited to try Dj's bagels after reading all the positive reviews.  I arrived and it was quite busy, still looking good.  I ordered a bacon egg and cheese on garlic and a dozen bagels to go.   After I took my seat I started rifling through the bagels and they were all quite hard.  I tore open the egg and rye bagels and they seemed old.  I asked the staff if they may be day old bagels and they assured me that they were freshly made same day.  

I know what fresh bread tastes like and what it feels like.  Can someone from the management please help me understand why the bagels were all stale?  Do you make them on site or are they baked very early in the morning?  I was completely underwhelmed by the bagels.  

On a positive note the Dj's Brewed coffee blend was good.",2,WsujTSsma39hIpxN-Lb53g

"I'm a big believer in delineating between life's wants and needs. 
And that's why I regularly visit the Thumb. SImply put, it has all my needs.
For example:

I don't want gas for my truck, I need gas for my truck. 

Eating bbq doesn't qualify as a want, but it is a need.

My truck runs just as efficiently dirty as it does clean. 
But I did hit a bird and squashed a couple of rabbits last month, so a wash and detail is kind of a need at the moment.

A savage blowjob is also a need, I think. Or maybe it's a want, who knows. 
I'm not sure. 
Anyway, they don't feature blowjobs here, least-ways, I'm pretty certain of it.

Ok, fine. 
Maybe The Thumb doesn't have ALL my needs, but it does have most stuff and, at fair prices.

I recommend the brisket.
Also, the full-service wash.
Enjoy the patio seating for lunch, especially this time of year so you can lust after all the cool RV's next door at the storage facility.
I'd like to steal a real nice one.
Maybe go running around Scottsdale showing off in my new ride with some hot little knob-gobbler who also needs to eat bbq.",4,onW5J6HswckxqzDmpvmR0A
"So sad how hard it is to find decent ethnic restaurants in NE Ohio--another shining example of how Taco Bell with table service is presented as ""authentic"" Mexican food. It's like saying ""authentic"" American--what exactly does that mean?",2,Y9cHnuhPab_5eWbj6k5f3A
"I have now visited La Mestiza twice, and I can't say enough good things about this place. We've struggled to find good Mexican food in Madison. La Mestiza will not satisfy your need for a giant burrito or tacos - it's not the traditional Mexican restaurant you find in America with combination plates. La Mestiza serves a relatively small menu composed of dishes highlighting the traditional regional cuisines of Mexico. 

The dishes are a little bit pricey, but you get everything you expect in a pricey meal. The presentation is gorgeous, and the food is fresh and delicious. I personally recommend the enchiladas pollo con mole - their traditonal Oaxacan mole sauce is phenomenal, with all the subtle nuttiness and rich chocolate flavors I pray for when I order mole. We've ordered specials as well as the carne asada, and they all elicited ""ooo""s and ""aahhh""s. They have an excellent house margarita and a couple of Mexican draft beers.

The restaurant is very small, but cozy and pleasant. This is a casual restaurant that attracts a wide variety of people. The decor is inviting and comfortable, with interesting artwork hanging on the walls and paper cut-outs strung from the ceiling in a playful, un-tacky sort of way. Do come here to eat at a table - the bar only has a couple of chairs and seems to be intended only for people who are waiting for their take-out orders.

Finally, the service is excellent. I've had two different servers (who were both there both times I've visited), and they offer the knowledgeable, understated, and appropriately attentive service I would expect from a fine dining restaurant.",5,evfAdXEAwzEutedxPhKQNA

"This place deserves zero stars. My 3 yr only went there for 4 weeks. During that time she was bullied and came home with large bruises. I spoke to her teacher and the director about it and neither seemed to really care. When I mentioned that my daughter was being bullied, the teacher actually laughed. Very unprofessional. They are not good at dealing with food allergies either. The final straw was when my child came home with bruises on her neck and told me that the bully had choked her!! I spoke to the teacher and director again and nothing was ever done. They didn't even apologize! This place may look nice inside but it is total chaos with little teacher supervision or interaction. There's no learning or preschool activities either. I'm totally disgusted by this place.",1,xPFfhrdxSOJlyfvnbwBekw
"The Weary Traveler was my first introduction to Madison and set the tone for a great visit with a family member who had just moved nearby.  If I lived in the neighborhood I'd eat at the Weary regularly with friends.  It seems like a great place to meet new people, given the warm woodsy layout and the low-tech emphasis (board games). In addition to the neighborhood vibe, the food was homey too. My $15 pork loin special with celery root side was delicious.  My dining partner happily consumed the Bad Breath Burger.  I had one of the many tasty beers on the menu - in fact you could make a game of trying all the beers.  This seems like a cozy place to settle in on a cold Wisconsin night.  I look forward to many return trips.",4,bEvR6AuGKDLNXNS4F0-3MA
"Just like Taylor, I just had the same experience when trying to make an appointment with this office.  I was asked about my insurance before my question of whether or not they are accepting new patients was even answered.  I was told November is the earliest new patient appointment and when I said I would like to move forward, the female I was speaking with, I think she said her name was Mary but she said it so quickly I can't be certain, placed me on hold.  After 5 and a half minutes,I hung up.  Poor potential patient experience!  I am calling for help, not to have my time wasted.  As an individual who works 60 hours a week, I don't have time to sit on hold, especially when you are only taking appointment calls between 8:30am and 4:30pm.  If she had come back on the line to provide an update, it may have evoked a better response but when you are forced to call for an appointment and cannot make an appointment online, the staff needs to be more on top of their game.",1,W8WnGODtxRswKlyfJa4Fog

"Recently purchased a truck from this company, and really have nothing but good things to say. They weren't pushy, I haven't found any hidden issues with the vehicle, and I was able to get a two year warranty. They actually Called me after the purchase and lowered my interest rate, offering more than one option through several lenders. As it relates to the previous reviews in relation to being unable to be approved for credit, this isn't a company issue, rather an issue a consumer should be aware they may experience based off their debt to income ratio. One thing I will say after purchasing the truck  is that it had 3 different types of  tires on it, so I was required to purchase a matching set. I will take fault for this though due to my failure to inspect the vehicle thoroughly, and I did purchase the vehicle at night. Overall, I would recommend working with them If your interested in a truck.",4,UqGDxtBASkiS47v94L14jw

"I wonder if I am just being negative tonight?  Oh, well, on with the review...

When we were first seated, we were served water in tall skinny glasses & seasoned popcorn in tiny buckets, very cute & unique.

We ordered 6 items and shared: Singapore Greens & Nutty Popeye (salads), Hodgepodge (a tower of fried treats), Diablo Eggs, Elote (a corn on the cob dish that I didn't try), and Smokey Poke.

Menu Link:
http://www.noshandswig.com/nosh%20and%20swig%20menu.pdf

The salads were served in mason jars with the dressing on the side.  The jars are so you can shake the salad with dressing; clever.  Both were tasty though the Singapore Greens need a protein to round out the flavor profile, IMO. 

The Hodgepodge consisted of pomme frites, tempura sweet potato,
truffle tots, & onion rings.  I liked the truffle tots, but a little overboard on the truffle oil & salt.  The presentation is a twisted & tiered tower; I posted a picture

The Diablo Egss are deviled eggs (obviously), pretty regular, a little on the salty side; there is a recurring theme, appearing here.

The elote was grilled corn in garlic butter with cayenne & topped with cilantro pesto.  I didn't try, sorry.

Finally the Smokey Poke; little ahi tuna blocks in citrus ponzu, garnished with norichips & some type of fried squash or potato slices.  Great presentation & flavor, but SALTY...

Ok, I broke down our food, now for service.  It was feast or famine: repeat visits in a short period of time or no one for many tens of minutes.  They were trying hard, I could tell, but they didn't appear to have any type of ""table visit rotation"" procedure. The waitstaff was friendly, regardless.

Finally, ambiance.  There were cute touches, like the sign for the bathrooms was a street sign called ""Flushing Avenue"", clever.  Decorations were sparse and the feel, to me, was that of a hipster automat.  I didn't mind it, but it also doesn't stand out.

I am hoping that all these issues are due to its relative age.  I will definitely try here again though it is FAR from my regular stomping grounds.  Great ideas & concepts, but spotty execution is my overall impression.  Oh, yeah, and salt.",3,qbsmWd9Ot-u1PDO-QlQlSA
"The pictures, the reviews... none of them do The Spa at Mandarin Oriental justice.  This is one of those ""you have to experience it for yourself"" type of places.  Five stars doesn't even scratch the surface of what type of service and accommodations you will receive when you spend your day here.  My mom and I decided to spend a full day and sample as much as we could possibly fit in... with some downtime in between services.  Booking appointments with the concierge - wonderful, informative, and top notch.  Arrive and check-in - fabulous.  This is the only spa I have been to where they have you complete a full health intake form - VERY MUCH appreciated.  All while you enjoy delicious hot tea, a cool cloth, and the removal of your shoes to be replaced with spa sandals.  The spa attendants were WONDERFUL and incredibly attentive.  Fresh tea, cold water, explanations of the facility... very thorough.

Mom and I started with the day with a Hammam treatment.  What a delight for the senses.  Firm, soft, hot, cold, warm... One of the most incredible treatments I have ever experienced.  I couldn't stop touching my legs for two days after - I was so silky, it was insane.  If you do ONE thing at The Spa - try the Hammam.  A total delight for the senses.

The Jade Enzyme facial was incredible and relaxing.  The Detox Foot Treatment was also incredible.  All of it.  Amazing.  I didn't even get to excessively use the facilities as I had originally intended... next time.  I spent most of my time relaxing on the warmed tiled loungers overlooking LV Boulevard or nestled up in the cozy beds in the relaxation room with a cup of hot tea and a bottle of ice water.

Next time I go back, I will be booking the Time Ritual... two hours and fifty minutes of treatments customized specifically for my body's needs that day?  Oh heck yes!  Scrub me, rub me, make me melt!  I cannot wait to return!

As for the prices and the three lines of tips... get over it and show the people that make this place so wonderful a little respect... or don't come here for service.  These folks are working at one of the, if not THE best spa in Vegas and certainly command the prices that you will pay.  They are working very hard to make sure that you get your money's worth and I am a firm believer in gratuity that is commensurate with that effort.  So if you get a little sticker shock... head up strip to a different spa.  Tip rant off.

All in all and magical experience.  Worth every dollar and then some.  Looking forward to going back in a few months and trying a few different services.

If you don't want to valet, park in the Aria self-park and walk over to the Mandarin.  It is a surprisingly short and easy walk... when you arrive at the hotel, you take the elevator to the 23rd floor and then take the guest elevators down to the 8th floor.  It is a bit of an adventure, but plan for a little extra time just in case.  The hotel itself is also gorgeous and I hear that their high tea in their tea lounge is not to be missed.  Adding that to my 'next time' list!",5,F4Pn-nRpdjhwV_DYElLJZA
"We've been going to Nuevo for the past 10 years and loved the place. I'm not sure what has happened these past 2 years we've noticed that the quality and service have been going down hill. The food taste was off and the waitress weren't very nice. I'd get tired of waiting for a water refill and would go get it myself. As of yesterday they've reached a new low. Now, the place is just gross and disgusting. Never again will we go back. How they can prepare food that taste so bad and the waitress that has a ""you're annoying me"" attitude.... we're done.... it's sad because now we have to find a new place...

"Upon being told that they make their truffles themselves, I decided to try a few.  The flavors they had were not awfully creative, but their execution was generally successful.  The earl grey truffle actually tasted like earl grey, and the lemon truffle was well-balanced.  They also had a nice consistency when I bit into them, neither too hard nor too soft.

This review is based only on their truffles, I have not tried any of their cakes or ice creams.  They also explained that they have a smaller variety of truffles in the summer due to weaker demand.",4,BUKQi9YVrrjpVjP5uJhVHQ
"A pretty establishment on the second floor of Planet Hollywood. Its expensive for what it is but I appreciated the service. Our waiter took the time to answer our questions about the different dishes and was very helpful.

The cocktails were $15 bucks each and about what you would expect. I had the kobe beef rolls which was average. I am not sure what the hype is about kobe beef and sushi, it was about 26 bucks for 5 pieces which is simply not worth it. I also had a rock shrimp tempura which was around 15 bucks and was excellent. 

If staying at Planet Hollywood, I would give it a try, but otherwise your high end strip hotel will offer something comparable.",4,jVL7vM7iICr-7Rwh_L6GZw
"I was invited to Monkey Pants for a friends going away party. There was several of us there and I was definitely looking forward to having a good time since i'm a big fan of dive bars. I arrived and most everyone was already there enjoying their drinks. I waited about 15 minutes before I asked someone if we even had a waitress.... My buddy told me there was only 1 waitress/bartender working. After another 5 min I decided to just go to her at the bar. As I was getting up she was heading our way. She explained that this was her first day back from not bartending for a few years and she was the only one scheduled for another hour and a half. This made me change my game plane and I started ordering 2 beers so I wouldn't have to wait for a refill quickly. I gotta say for it just being her she hustled the best she could and I give her props, however, management should have known Friday nights gets busy and they should have at least had a waitress scheduled. It wasn't really right for the employee or the customer to have to deal with this. 

I ordered a burger with green chile and continued my 2 beer orders and that went rather well... The burger took a long time, im guessing a little over 30 minutes. I was a little frustrated with that but the burger was actually really good. I asked for some condiments and never got them, im sure it was because the waitress/bartender was slammed so I wasn't too worried about it. 

After awhile a waitress and another bartender showed up to take over and everything started running a lot more smoothly. Beers were flowing, shots were going down smooth, and we got our ordered items quickly. Around 8pm Karaoke started and it was on!!! I chose a couple songs and handed them to the DJ... I was told my songs weren't available.... I gave him a couple more and nope.... So if your planning to Karaoke make sure your gonna stick to the same ol same ol songs... Thunder Rolls, Baby got back, Grease, or a balls song. The DJ offered me to pay for songs I wanted to sing. I was going to tip him anyway so I paid the 2 dollars for 1 of my songs. Sang the song and dipped... Overall its a pretty chill bar, manager screwed the one waitress hopefully that doesn't become a pattern on Friday nights. Id roll thru again if my friends wanted to go there again.",2,8GXZG8ZIrImtq4bzMSC4Ag

"I would rather go to the dentist then go back to this place.  You want to talk about POOR service, its no wonder the USPS is loosing to UPS Stores and other mail places.

If we could have done what we needed done at the UPS store, we would have instead of coming here.  Let me expand.

We came in and of course there was a line with only 2 people behind the counter and one guy walking around trying to look busy..  We were there to do a door to door mailer which he even came over as soon as we came in and confirmed with us.  After about 5 minutes of standing in line, this guy came over and started pulling people with only one piece of business over to another counter.  

As he took some from the back of the line and some from in front of us, we eventually moved to be second in line.  The lady who was first had 5 packages to send out and said she was passed over 3 times.  She finally got called to the counter and we moved to be first in line, our time now nearing 30 minutes.  

After standing there for another 5 minuites, this guy trying to look busy finally came over and told us to come to his counter.  Our transaction with him took less then 3 minutes.  

So, IF ANYONE AT THE USPS READS THIS....If you have a floater, they should take the next person in line and help them if they can, not pick and choose who you want to help and when you run out of options then help the person you have been skipping over and over and over....You want to know why you are loosing business, because of employees like this....",1,L7M7GQax2JeykRX7UeQUKA
"I ask my husband for one of these for my birthday every year.  The cake part comes in like 8 different flavors, but good old chocolate is my favorite.  The cake is moist and flavorful and dense, but somehow doesn't seem heavy or processed.  And it's not too sweet.  How do they manage that?

But the real kicker is the cream cheese frosting.  yes, my friends, this is what it's all about.  That thick, tangy, sweet, frosting all over that yummy, moist cake.  I think I may have to pick one up on the way home.",4,YdY94B7EeV-gk-2Vu82vEg

One of the better steakhouses @ Vegas. I am a huge fan. Best restaurant in New York New York casino. Ribeye is probably the best. Great wine selection as well. Creme of spinach + potatoes are also very good.,5,f8MvIoSdxXx8Phq9X_5WEQ
"It's nice to have something onsite. The staff is very nice. The food is good, but the prices are high. I've only eaten here a handful of times, because I don't have the average $10-15 a day to spend.",3,EmKLsdSexrp5s_ykkQUaoA
"First of all the woman at the counter was super friendly and helpful, major points for that! The cupcakes were good, not too sweet, frosting was a little dense and a touch sweet. Overall good, but not the best I've had. I'd definitely go back and try other flavors!  5 stars for customer service, 3 star cupcakes.",4,vkMeyKIufyf8W6sZToHQ6g
"tried goi guon and phô today.
apparently all the prices and foods is more valuable in chinatown. i would say go to pho bang ny",5,o7b1LyyIDwonsUkqRqBcRA
This is an awful place to visit if you just want real food. They do not offer any of the typical Japanese food other than street food. Might be good if you just want to waste money of several pieces of karaage.,1,rxZ1K5S5G5qPOFer71TMFg
"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Food is amazing, happy hour is on point, and the service was phenomenal. Sit in the patio lounge during happy hour, especially in nice weather. Also, Jonathon is my favorite server!! Such a nice guy! He was SO on top of our orders! With a crazy big Italian family, that means a lot. Definitely ask for him!!! Yum, yum, yum!!!",5,zCFap4eNLRYMJjuivz9TNg
I have never written a review to start off with. I literally downloaded Yelp just to write this.  I went to this Chick-Fil-A earlier and was pretty surprised went they told me my card got declined. I told them I would be right back and drove away leaving no explanation really. After leaving thru their drive thru  I realized that they had already given me our drinks.. I called back after 5 minutes and told them that I was sorry that I drove away not realizing I already got the drinks and that I was just calling the bank to see why my card got declined. They said not to worry and they understand and I told them That I was on my way back. When I got to the window they said that because I was honest and called about the drinks that they would take care of the order and I didn't have to pay for it. My heart seriously melted ..not because of the money but because of the act of kindness from these 2 specific girls (I should have gotten their name.) it was seriously the nicest thing that has happened to me in a long time. Just the thought of doing something so sweet and nice left such an impression on me. We have always been a fan of this restaurant but now I'm a greater fan. Thank you for having such amazing customer service ...most drive thru's can't wait to throw the food at you with no smile at all. You're employees have always left such a positive impression even before today. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.,5,JJXlijYWX2hGbBuLW8B8-Q
"Yes, this is a KFC, so I won't bother reviewing the food. Besides, it's not the food here that's bad... it's the service! Staffed by hostile and indifferent teenagers, the missus and I stopped going to this KFC for a long time, as staff were surly and our orders were almost always incorrect. Nowadays we only tend to go there for the occasional single item (a small cole slaw or Snacker), as we don't think they'll get it right.

I think the management of this location needs to impart on their staff that many folks come to KFC to get meals for their entire families. I wouldn't complain so much if Taco Bell messed up a 99¢ burrito... but if I'm paying KFC $20 for a family meal and they forget the biscuits or give us the wrong sides, or give us Extra Crispy when we ordered Original I'm going to be ANGRY!

They also need to understand that, at their prices, no one's going to put up with this. I can get far better chicken at Price's for nearly the same money... so why go to KFC?",2,lgAgzNndW-SgfX-kkG2TMw
"Disgusting! This was at the bottom of my shake, how did this get there ?!?! This was my first time at Cook Out and I WOULD NEVER return here. This is unacceptable because there is no reason for this to be here somebody either had to notice the cup broke and did not care or I don't even know this just ruined my day.",1,-j8IFt5OsbOeZLb3qHCT-A
"I came here for some ideas for my Niece's birthday gifts. Such cool items in this store! The cookbooks and kitchen gadgets are so creative and fun!

There were two ladies working and very helpful, they assisted me with kitchen twine as an idea to tie my gifts together. They were very helpful as I can't see colours very well. They really went above and beyond, helping me match the colour of the twine to my gift wrap, they were patient with me

I will definitely return!",5,giZBXucsq_sgMGGkmyrL2Q
"Went here mid afternoon for a late lunch. The place wasn't too terribly busy and I was seated immediately. The place has a nice selection of beers and a simple food menu. The staff was extremely friendly and the waiter was particularly helpful, providing his honest opinion of the menu items and sharing feedback he received from other patrons. I very much appreciated his sincerity rather than simply saying, ""Oh, everything here is really great!"" I ended up getting the chicken sandwich. This was not the best chicken sandwich I've ever had but it was still very good, as it was flavorful and well-sized. The coleslaw was not good at all but thankfully that was just a tiny part of the meal. The fries were just fries: nothing to write home about but nothing wrong with them either. In a nutshell, great staff and beer selection, good food and ambiance. A solid 4-Star experience.",4,tr2IcNkckbZ8GGYo8z1a0w
"We were visiting Freemont and doing the tourist thing when we needed a bite to eat.  Rather than one of the many expensive restaurants we've already visited, we chose Hennessey's to get away from that.  It was reasonably priced and good food.  

We shared the fish and chips (really good and beer battered) and the Reuben (not perfect, but good corned beef).

Despite the crowd on the street, it was not really busy - which is a shame, because the places in the casinos are either much more expensive or not as good food.  It helped that our waitress was very nice and attentive.

I definitely recommend it.",4,e37ICUCsbQzDbD-9VyxikQ
"My partner and I were looking for a good brunch place and we saw some really good reviews for this place so we decided to check it out.
I honestly am really unsure why this place got the good reviews it did. It looks okay when you walk in, modern decor, clean setting. But both mine and my partners food were very, very unsatisfying. I ordered home fries, two eggs over-medium, whole wheat toast and coffee. The only thing cooked to order was the home fries- but the ketchup they gave us was over a year expired. Yuck? My eggs were heavily salt and peppered and over-hard, my toast wasn't even toasted. It was just slightly warm bread. And our coffees were a sickly sweet hazelnut, which neither of us had asked for. We both left disappointed and unsatisfied and walked to the Starbucks down the street to get ""better"" coffee. 
The service was okay, though it was unclear if we pay at the register or the table, since our order was taken at the table but there was a sign saying you were supposed to order at the register. Confusing. I wouldn't recommend.",1,lLd2A-X_6TxtXxFpJpQIdA
"I was taking stroll through Town Square recently when I came across this gem of a shop.  What initially drew me in was the window display of big beautiful geodes.  I've been looking for a store in Las Vegas that features these items for so long!  Not only do they have an amazing selection but their prices, service and expertise were beyond impressive. 

In addition to their geodes, they also have a great selection of Native American jewelry, artifacts, incense, and pottery.  I highly recommend this store!",5,xQCPXPZrkFRG4uiAfvA47w
"this is pretty much a cheesecake factory but with a different name.  at first glance, this place seems tiny, but when  you actually walk inside, it's huge.  this is a great place to go when you don't want to pay the expensive prices of a 5 star restaurant or want something more than the everyday buffet.  i would have given this place 5 stars, but it was busy and packed.  our waiter concentrated on the group of bachelorettes.  i don't blame him but there are other people to focus on.  other than the service and the wait, i'd definitely come back here.",4,XsV5Izqao7dnDl61dBNx0w
"If you're staying at the MGM Grand, I recommend trying Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill. I ate there for lunch and dinner and shared a total of 6 dishes. I suggest the Corned Beef Reuben with Sauerkraut and Swiss on Rye with Potato Salad for $15 if you want a good deli style sandwich. The Fish of the Day (Halibut) with Wild Mushrooms and Pearl Onions, Creamy Corn Puree and Tomato Fondue for $31 was also very good. For salads, I thought the Chopped Vegetable Salad with Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons and Creamy Greek Dressing was very good and can easily be shared with people as an appetizer.

The portions vary between the dishes. I thought the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sweet Fennel-Sausage Bolognese for $23 was a little on the small side compared to the Sweet Pea and Goat Cheese Filled Tortellini with Wild Mushrooms and Parmesan Reggiano for $25. You also can't go wrong with the Grilled Prime Burger with Vermont Cheddar and Smoked Onion Marmalade for $18. 

The Crab cakes were delicious, $17 for 4 crab cakes. When comparing Wolfgang Puck's prices to other MGM restaurants, this place is very reasonable and the servers provided excellent service both times I dined. Nice atmosphere too. I would go eat here again.",4,kLgGOs3z5RST1TgBf44Urw
"I feel the need to tell all my fellow Yelpers about the HORRIBLE service I received at Winners yesterday morning. Let's start at the beginning. 

I got there right at 9am, supposedly when they open, and I watched as the employees sat around on the counters and chatted in what seemed to be a staff meeting. It was freezing outside and considering it was 9am I was expecting the door to open any minute. 

I waited and I waited. I watched as one by one, the employees noticed me standing outside, and one by one, they peeked their heads around and just stared. You'd think someone would have come to my rescue, but nope. They just continued sitting around on the counters and occasionally looking back to see if I was still there. 

I finally got inside at 9:10am (which SUCKS because by this point, I'm late for work) and I told them I had to return an item. The assistant manager said ""Malcolm will help you on the other side"". So i walked around to the other side and I stood at the cash register waiting as Malcolm tried to figure out how to put his 'Winners' apron on. Finally, Malcolm looks at my item and says ""You're returning this? You cut off the tags"". I'm like ""Yeah, but I bought it 12 hours ago and it doesn't say on the receipt anything about keeping the tags on"". He lost it on me. He angrily pointed to this sign that Winners has that states their policy. He's all like ""You cut off the tags! You're not supposed to cut off the tags. We don't return items with the tags cut off."" Finally he said ""Fine, this ONE time, I'll do it, but never again"". He was BY FAR one of the rudest people I have ever dealt a minute after opening. 

Finally he finished punching away at the register, shoved the receipt and cash on the counter and completely ignored me. I grabbed it and left the store immediately. 

I will never, not EVER, step foot inside this Winners again. Their service is atrocious and I urge all my fellow Yelpers to pick any place to shop but this one.",1,o_jXkSmcsxESRQnQhoZb0g
"I'm so happy they opened this new location. The one in old town is wonderful and this new one is just as good with even more amazing staff. We stopped in for a drink and decided to stay for 3! The atmosphere was open and fun. They have an upstairs bar and a downstairs bar. As well as patios on both levels. When we went to the upstairs bar, we were greeted right away despite no open bar stools available and the bar staff came out from behind the bar to take our order. As soon as bar stools opened up, they pointed them out for us. The downstairs bar staff (especially Stephen) was friendly and attentive. We made reservations to come back for dinner on Friday. I'm sure it won't disappoint.",5,I6v1M9v0oXphZxHgHdzzLg
"What happened to taste and flavours?! Practically all the dimsum dishes were so bland.  For the first time the sirracha bottle was being used by every member of my family, which was comical but what's a person to do when food tastes like nothing.
The bill came to $136 including tips for 38 dishes of dimsum.  So that's  $27 per person.
I can get a good meal else where for what i paid.",1,SWLJ-_Dtyx5gaLejIHEOiw
"I want to have every meal of the day here!

This was my first experience with Flemings and it won't be my last! 
The padres and I came here for an early dinner on a Sunday. When we arrived, we had the restaurant to our selves and settled in on our second table (my mom didn't like the first one) which was a comfy horseshoe shaped booth in the corner. I perused the wine list, which is on one of those fancy iPads, and choose a yummy Zinfandel that appeared before me in no time! 

I was trying to eat healthy and started with the Fleming's salad (candied walnuts and  cranberries!) and then had the New Bedford Scallops that were perfectly cooked and accompanied with a delicious lemon-honey glaze (my mouth is salavating as I write this). My mom was super boring and I honestly dont remember what she ordered, but she enjoyed it. My Dad, however, loved his dish that they only serve one day a week. On Sunday's they offer a prime rib special that includes a appetizer salad, two sides, and a dessert...you need to come on Sundays. This was one of the best prime ribs he as ever in the 35+ years he has been living in Arizona. For his/my sides he ordered the sautéed mushrooms and the BLUE CHEESE mashed potatoes! Everything was incredibly tasty and I still had my Dad's dessert to devour! 

For dessert, my Dad ordered the Carrot cake, BUT, my mom mentioned earlier that I was recently engaged and in addition to the carrot cake (which was amazing, the spice was so delicious and the cake itself was incredibly fresh and moist) we got to indulge in the super gooey Chocolate melted volcano cake (I couldn't stop eating the creamy center filled with chocolate sauce and I am NOT a chocolate person), the refreshing Pistachio ice cream with a yummy tuile (that's a fancy name for a buttery walffald/cookie/cone, thanks Andrea for helping me with my ""classy"" lessons), and, my favorite, the light, yet dense creme brulle...ugh, so good! Oh, and since they knew I was watching my figure, we also got to try their house made whipped cream that you could eat as a dessert on its own!

The food was fantastic and the serivce...more fantastical (even when the restaurant started to fell up)! From the friendly hostess who greeted us, to Adam, the server's assistant, to the BEST WAITRESS EVER, Andrea, and even the manager, Jessica, all were extremely friendly and really seemed to care about how our dining experience turned out. 

Five stars all the way!",5,7j477VKlA8Oh3NFme-sv7Q
Extremely underwhelming...Cool to sit in the same (casual room) room as the fire pit but too pricey for what they are serving. Very small portions. Better places in the city to spend $150 (2 people). Sorry...,2,jDfXyS_kY9IIuv5NqCqpfA

"We usually don't ""celebrate"" Valentine's Day but my husband surprised me with reservations on Valentines weekend, we had both been wanting to try this place since it opened.
The restaurant is beautiful, so many different things to look at, watching the food being prepared, of course people watching. For the most part the staff was friendly and accommodating, maybe a bit too stuffy for such a fun restaurant.
We both had a bourbon we had never tried while we perused the menu and made our choices. 
We're both huge steak fans and the scent of charred steak permeated the air, so we agreed to share a Rib eye from Rosewood Texas, recommended by our server.  We shared the Classic Tartare to start, it was good but I've had better and I think I prefer it with toast as opposed to the soft rolls they served it with, it's that texture thing that would've helped. We eventually got our steak, oh baby! Again it was good, but I've had better, actually at a few places, if you have meat in your name, you better serve the best meat I've ever had! 
We shared some sides of Catalan Spinach which I loved...the flavor combos were perfect! Then we couldn't pass up the Robuchon potatoes that are described as butter, butter, more butter and some potatoes. So smooth and creamy, the first few bites are extraordinary you don't want to stop eating them but then you feel that your mouth is just coated in butter and no matter what you eat, it can not be cleansed. Ick! I craved something like lemon sorbet but alas nothing even close to it on the menu, so we got Ten Little Pieces Dessert to share and take some home for later. They were tasty morsels, just nothing to rave about.
We're kind of bummed at the bank roll we dropped here, just to be...""Meh"". At least we got this place out of our system, on to the next ""I have to try"" place.",4,NO4X-PBjZrOtunWU12AjsA
"We went here awhile ago for my graduation party, steak was dead cold when served and we waited almost an hour for it. I guess they kind of forgot about us and left it there all that time.

US Egg is by far my favorite breakfast place in the valley.   If you've never had a protein pancake Santa Fe half and half you're missing out in life.   The people who go to US Egg and are disappointed are the people who have clearly never had a protein pancake or waffle because it's basically heaven.  One try and you'll never want another pancake again!  If only I could figure out the batter I'd probably live on them.,5,Chi3xNF0KwipYeV29AasGg
"Had a reservation, waited an hour and a half. Asked for compensation for the wait because no one offered anything while we were waiting. The owner offered to pay for all our drinks and then when the bill came, charged us for the drinks we ordered. The table sitting next to us called out the owner and expressed that they too, heard that the owner had said he could pay for our drinks given our long wait. 

I have never been spoken to the way in which this owner had spoke to me, especially with a reservation.

While the food was good, I would never want anyone to support such a disrespectful man.",1,eiAPiNwNZFDfC0v-QgO8sw
This is one of our favorites.  Saw the new place in Goodyear and ate dinner there on January 31st 2016.  They were packed as anticipated but there was room at the bar so we opted for that.  Quality of food and service was as expected.  Never a bad meal yet an any Oregano's we've been to.,5,ZnPHJZnO86adwIu8Y9HybQ
Don't know what happened! Usually love that location but today I went in and the restaurant had a VERY BAD smell.  Got my food to go and got home and took a bite and it tasted JUST like the smell in the restaurant.. Threw it away.. Will definitely try again but if the restaurant smells the same I'm turning my ass around and going elsewhere!,1,6Gm2JJlztxz_pJ0WlYuoZQ
The all you can eat sushi was awesome. The spicy  just right. The bacon sushi was really good we ordered it twice. But all the sushi was great. The shrimp lover was really good.

"An upscale yet casual and chill bar with a fun, retro atmosphere on King St. 
Overall great food and huge selection of beers! Their beers, mussels, and Belgian frites are really popular. We loved the Spicy Beef Tacos and Belgian White Mussels. The Bistro Salad was good, nothing special. The Lamb Shortloin tasted okay and is overpriced, as there was much more of the chickpea salad than lamb pieces. 
Our server was fantastic- unfortunately I didn't catch her name :/ She was super attentive and helpful taking our orders, recommending and offering us tasters of different draft beers.",4,aOD0q4DX_V74UzN3GKAerA
"This place is ok. I actually didn't realize before i went in that all they have is ramen. with that tonkatsu pork thrown in. some chicken. I went in thinking it was a general japanase soups place. udon. soba. etc. ramen is my least favourite kind of noodle. reminds me of mr. noodle cups.

well, the food was alright, but the soups they serve would not have been my picks. not a big fan of fried things being thrown in soups. something about that just doesn't work. something fried should be crispy.

anyway, that said, this is a neighbourhood place for me, so if i was really hungry and was sick of eating shawarma on that particular day, i might stumble in again.",3,1jnCery6YmRfyYgDZtUbxA
"This is a great spot! I've been twice now, first time brunch on the back patio and last weekend dinner indoors.

"First time trying Kinton after a long ramen withdrawal. The menu has several steps to build your own ramen. I decided to go with the original pork shoulder ramen in a light broth. The meat was a bit dry but the noodles were good and the broth was indeed light, a bit too light on the umami. Egg was cooked perfectly with that gooey runny yolk. Also ordered some appetizers. The spicy karage had a nice kick to it. Meat was juicy with a nice crispy exterior. The dumplings were decent. We were seated right in front of the open kitchen so we watched the whole ramen making process as we ate. Nice friendly atmosphere and the washrooms are really clean and elegant. Would come back and get the pork belly next time.",4,-X8cWodpCT1ehiDjRkCnuA
"Mostly a nice place, though there were a couple things that bugged me. They were: a) no coffee in the room, b) everything sold in the hotel stores was 2-3x normal prices, c) there was no trash can in the bathroom, and, d) sandpaper for toilet paper. The paper in the public restrooms was of much higher quality than in the room. The art in the hallway was sad as well. Though not a deciding factor on staying there, it annoyed me each morning and evening. The casino was OK, though many slot machines seemed to have broken and mislabeled buttons. There were very few of those annoying ""no smoking"" areas, which is nice.",3,K_1q8diQwab2c3qym1qckw

Since this Franchisee also considers the advertised rates as ""discounted"" will not accept them.  I have contacted the Franchisor (Regis Corp) about this but so far have gotten nowhere.

"The BLTAE is one of the best breakfast sandwiches in town! It's like your standard BLT fused with avocado toast, plus the pop of pesto and two eggs, served open-faced on thick-cut grilled brioche. It's even more fantastic than it sounds (and looks!), and I'd come back to their inconvenient downtown location with annoying garage parking just to have it again.

My guy raved just as much about the lemon poppy seed pancakes, though I would have appreciated more of the blueberry-ginger compote. I'm not much of a sugar for breakfast person, but we'll be coming back for the carrot and coconut version soon. 

NOTE: Full menu available even at opening, which means you can channel your inner five year old and order mac and cheese for breakfast! Unfortunately, I found the Ritz-cracker crust unnecessarily thick and salty, and the noodles overcooked. It may be best to stick to bfast options after all.",4,aP0WQQRH4m5dink-P3V4ZQ
"This place is actually a great place to study while enjoying something to eat. The food was pretty good for the price. The menu had a variety of choices which made it difficult to choose from, but the choices all seemed fairly delicious.

"Usually one to avoid the chain restaurant or any place that screams concept, I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful experience I had this evening at Nothing But Noodles on Elizabeth Avenue near CPCC. 

After a very long week of work which ended in a very long Friday, my husband and I wanted a quick and painless dinner so after seeing a coupon in one of the weekly mailers (the mailers that usually sit on the counter until the coupons are expired) we decided to run out for a ""buy one get one free"" bowl of noodles.

We both ordered the rice noodles with peanut sauce and split some pot stickers.  The service was fantastic.  The cashier was very nice without being saccharine even offering to explain the menu and ordering process.  The restaurant was impeccably clean with a sanitation score of 101.5 and not a spot of dirt anywhere.  Even the back of house (although there is really no back of the house as the kitchen is fully visible) was shiny and orderly.  Someone on staff was cleaning the entire time we were there. 

After we grabbed our drinks and sat down a server/bus person brought out our pot stickers.  We ate a couple and then started on the noodles.   The noodle portion was enormous with a flavorful homemade sauce and fresh vegetables.  A must have is the Key Lime pie.  It has a great crust and although the flavor is obviously key lime the creamy pie does not leave you with a perpetual pucker.

We noticed that they also offer homemade cotton candy for the kids which along with the other very kid friendly menu options, non-smoking atmosphere, unobtrusive music and pleasant lack of TVs' makes this a very family friendly restaurant.

All of that aside it was the customer service and attention to detail that made our experience truly remarkable.  The owner of the establishment was present and working at closing on a Friday night.  He takes pride in his restaurant and has obviously passed that on to his employees.  It is really refreshing to know that a business owner cares. 

Thank you Todd and the rest of the staff at Nothing but Noodles for an unexpected pleasure.  You really turned what was supposed to be a quick bit to eat into a great evening out.",5,hVnBv5RpLOI-it-aFjLNVg

But common on. They know you are on a tight time frame. I had 1 1/2 hours between flights. Now less than an hour.  I got up and sat at bar. At least service was better. Cosmo ok. Should have stuck with a beer. Still no food. May have to get it to go.",1,m3je8B9OEGhKrMiFrKJg9Q

The cookies have always been soft and amazing and the ice cream is Thrifty's.

These are seriously big enough that you can eat the ice cream and cookies separately, but be prepared for a major sugar high.",5,F_0VFeD575XUx3on5MCVsQ

"I've been to the Grand Concourse for lunch a few times, and the food has always been delicious, the wait staff great, and the setting is breathtaking- an old train station with stained glass windows and elegant tables and fixtures. You have to go there at least once as a Pittsburgher.

However, the real reason I love the Grand Concourse is their Sunday brunch buffet. It's ridiculous- rooms and rooms of delicious foods, literally a feast to end all feasts. Omelet bar, pancakes, waffles, and French toast made in front of you, a carving station, every kind of breakfast food you could dream of, pastries on pastries, and so much more. Everything tastes amazing, and you will not go hungry or want of food- you might even get some exercise walking from room to room to find all of the different choices. They even have a kids are with lower tables with kid friendly food like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

If you live in Pittsburgh and like a big breakfast, you can't miss the brunch at Grand Concourse!",4,f9VDZ9grROzCV1VpyGN8CA

"This is actually one of my favourite places for brunch in Toronto, I think. My SO does not seem to fancy it as much, but I don't know, she seems pretty satisfied every time we visit. 

You've read enough about their waffles....they're the best, blah blah blah.... mm so good, blah blah.... BUT IT'S TRUE!!!!! They are so light, perfect amount of sweetness and their SYRUP is SO AWESOME. Wow, I think I conveyed my craving and excitement enough - sorry caps lock police. They also offer a cornish hen for brunch - which is a treat. Any place you can have something a little fancier/different with your standard eggs brunch is superb in my books.

But, do you know what the best part of LPD is?! The fact that I can order a savoury and sweet brunch in one plate. E.g. eggs benny with waffles! I honestly could not ask for more from a breakfast establishment.

(I think I'll go here this weekend...)

It's true, the lines are ridiculous. I've swung by at prime brunch hour and the line was long enough to make me turn around and go to an alternative, but the line at 2pm - 2:30pm is bearable (just watch out, they close around 3). With that said, however, the wait time could change rapidly, obviously depending on the patrons inside. It's a gamble (odds being most likely long), but worth it.

Service - 4/5
Food - 5/5
Price - 3/5",4,auh5To53rJi7iuBp96fhrw
"Tucked away in a small plaza near Atkinson road is a fabulous middle eastern mom and pop restaurant.

Been here a few times and its great place for a lil shawarma snack and battered fries. Shawarmas are packed to the max and you'll definitely make a mess trying to eat them. The cheese perogies are frozen here, don't recommend it.

Nice servers. Will be back when in the area.",4,bYiHjBIfwx5dsEdCyMV4IQ
"Even for an outlet location, this place was a disaster- tons of employees running around but store in disarray, they frequently bumped into us, squeezed past us, and generally made shoppers feel like they were in the way. Management did not appear to be present.

Selection is decent, pricing was okay- most items 30 to 50% off ""lowest ticketed price"" which for most was the original price. Lots of outdated styles and clashing color combinations on the stocked merch, but if you need a sh-load of polo tees, this place has got you covered.",2,xtzGS1XO8YT-gHKKd3jvAQ

"LOOKING FOR AN HONEST AFFORDABLE LICENSED SERVICE? YOU JUST FOUND IT.

I confess this wasn't my first choice. My heat stopped working on our first night of temperatures in the 30s. In the morning I started calling all of YELP's top rated companies. I left voicemail after voicemail then called J & K - not yet rated. Julio (owner) picked up the phone and promised to come the same day. I crossed my fingers and hoped all would work out. 

He found the pilot light had gone out. Didn't charge me, but I asked him to come back and do routine maintenance - including replacing my filters and also insulting the outside water pipe to my home (he does plumbing too.) His charge? $60 for everything including all materials.

But what really set J & K apart from the several companies that have serviced my heating, cooling and plumbing needs before is instead of using his knowledge and expertise to get me to spend more money - he told me I didn't have to spend as much as before.

So I made another appointment for him to repair some plumbing problems I have in my master bath - the same problems I had repaired in my 2nd bath. I paid close to $700 for those repairs - Julio quoted $120, including materials and labor.

I will report if my future experience differs from these, but I'm thinking this is a homeowner's dream - competent, no attitude, priced honestly, licensed professional. Now if he just did all the other kinds of house repairs I need done....",1,Z-pxAyR6dMArNYnyJKDYYQ

"Thanks to winning these coveted Yelp tickets I was able to attend this great event Sunday night. It took a little bit of asking around to find the VIP ticket booth, but all I had to do was find the right person to ask. 

When my date and I first got there we walked around and noticed all of the very cool bars. Our favorite themes were the one that looked like candy land, and American Gladiators. We loved that each bar would make us their signature drink. 

The VIP area was very nice and a great place to rest your feet from all of the dancing. It did however, take people too long to get dancing. C'mon people, get on the dance floor! All of the people working the event were great, I could not have asked for better service. However, some of the people who attended were not gentlemen, but it's something you have to anticipate with all of the great drinks to be had. 

All in all a great night! Thanks Nikki, Kelly and I had a blast!",5,wUrxb-6FUdFt4v8_O6ugaw
"So I was a fan of the place that used to occupy this location.  It was with a bit of anxiety that I chose to go to the new restaurant.  However that anxiety was soon changed to happiness as I hungrily explored their expansive menu.  

Sushi Hero did a lot of modernizing to this place and although the other place was awesome, this place has a huge menu, amazing staff, fresh fish, and a great ambiance.  

Everything I ate exploded in my mouth with a variety of delicious flavors.  I will definitely be back, there are so many items I have yet to try.

It's definitely among my favorite all you can eat sushi places, not just on the East side  but in all the city.  If you're nearby, you owe it to your taste buds to give Sushi Hero a try.  Ask not what your taste buds can do for you, but what you can do for your taste buds.",5,7EiPtJJNRfbl5k4e8uEJ9Q

"Had the worst experience with Safeway this week.  Although I used to love their delivery service, I scheduled a delivery for Thursday between 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. and at 9:45 I received a call that they couldn't make it that day, but I could schedule a 2-hour window for Friday once customer service opened in the morning.  Called Friday morning and scheduled a delivery between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m., then worked from home to accommodate this delivery since I need my groceries for a dinner party Saturday that I'll have to start prepping Saturday morning.  At noon I was called and told that no one would deliver my groceries today.  After speaking with a customer services manager, AK, I was told someone would call me to make their best effort to arrange the delivery today.  An hour later, I get a call assuring me my groceries would NOT be delivered today but that I'd be called by customer service about delivery first thing Saturday morning.  It's now 3:30 and I've heard nothing from anyone.  Looks like I'll be waiting for my refund and getting my groceries at Fry's Food Stores tomorrow morning.",1,jWSn1lwn4AkacBRXe03TbQ

Plus, there was a taco eating contest so I guess we paid for entertainment, too! Our server (the owner) checked up on us frequently and asked if we needed anything else. I got the fish and chips, and they were amazing! We also got a side of chips and guac - they do not skimp you on the guac! Overall it was delicious and I will definitely be returning.",5,QdAAAyWx3HQ0w5exRW-2Tw

"This was my first time at this club and me and my friends had an amazing time . The DJ played great music from old hip hop to new hip hop even played a song my friends requested with a shout out which was super cool since most vegas DJ won't do that unless you slip a bill under the table for them . We reserved a Bottle service and it was a great deal for a vegas VIP but obviously way too pricey but that was expected and it was money well spent our waitress for the night wasn't so great so my friend mention something and minutes later another waitress came along she was blah as well but my 5 star review is for the guy helping the waitress buss around his name is AJ I believe hopefully I get his name right since it was way to loud in there and hard to hear , anyways he was amazing top of the line costumer service was on top of everything refilling the ice, juice getting us cups and so on..he blew my expectations off the roof and he didn't have to dress half naked to get out attention all 6 of us in our group were blown by how attentive he was with not just our seating area but with everyone else . Way to go AJ 5 starts to you and because of that we will be back . Thank you for the amazing service",5,NiLh8AW9f6uBmiG7gkhohw
"Wonderful food and that place is busy but never crowded like other locations. Nan has a shape of a sandal and is huge and very tasty.  I've tried most kebobs and my favorite is Sultani Kabob - a combination of chunks of filet Mignon and lean ground beef. Rice is perfect, too. It's always freshly prepared. 
Decor is very nice - perhaps similar to other locations. It features a famous (and my favorite) picture of an Afghan girl taken by Steve McCurry (google Sharbat Gula).
This location is fairly new in The Great Punjab Business Centre. One can go Indian grocery or fabric shopping while in that area. The Centre is large but not very frequented by locals - Bamiyan Kabob seems to be the busiest of all in the area.",5,jXS3i1DSwjnI1C4gKDgF3w
"This is so exciting. A new bakery moved into the space next door to my office. Not only do they bake fresh breads and buns on site, but they also serve Cha Time Bubble Tea in the same location. And to top it off, they also have fresh baguettes. And what's more, it's a Taiwanese chain and full of fancy buns that are not easily found not just in the hood but in the entire GTA! So I think this place has a LOT of potential for greatness. The space is awesome, the vibe is inviting and definitely feels like the kind of place I want in my hood. The only room for improvement is some of the bread are kind of dry. I would definitely suggest they work on that. For example matcha red bean was super dry. But some of the other bread such as the sweet taro bun was moist and lightly sweetened. I also loved the bacon twist bread. It went perfectly with my dinner and I can forsee me buying lots and lots of it in the future. 

Grand opening is on 9/17 but the place was packed when I went on the soft opening earlier in the week. It's currently cash only but hopefully they will setup the machines soon. Lots of samples to introduce you to all the flavours of breads, buns, cakes... Great selection, around 20 or so? Prices are reasonable for fancy bread with a range from $2-5 from what I saw. I still have a lot more to try but so far, LOVE!",5,jJbZOBnP6wTectCs-3DILw
"I came here very early morning at around 10am so I didn't run into any busy traffic with waiters, waiting for food or anything like that. Our waiter was very nice and helped me order since it was my first time being here. I ordered a pancake with bananas it was sweet n tasty, what I like about the pancakes here is that the ingredients (bananas, chocolate chips,etc) are actually baked in the pancakes they are not just tossed on top. Another great thing about the pancakes they are actually baked it makes a great difference they are sooo fluffy in the inside and on the outer side of the pancake crispy, yummy! I only ate half of the pancake. I also ordered there breakfast platter; 2 sunny side eggs were warm and tasty I ate only one , 2 sizzling sausages ate half of 1, and evenly cooked hash browns only ate a spoonful. Lastly I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy and omg they are the best I have ever tasted I highly recommend trying them out! They come with 2 biscuits I only ate one I so wanted to save the other one for later. I tried a little bit of everything I didn't finish everything and not because the food wasn't to die for but, because I did order a lot of food couldn't fit everything in my stomach. I guess I got carried away lol I so wanted to try everything on the menu.",4,kiEukBW31C1DX-hEb3dtYg
"We have a love/hate relationship with Chili's, we come here a couple of times, then we have a terrible experience and we stop coming here for a while... until it is long enough and the cycle starts all over again.

This time we had a good experience. Our server made all the difference, he was a kind of serious and extremely polite young man. He took really good care of us, I am not sure about his name, I think it may be Ted.

Hubby had the fajitas and there were very good and tasty. He added cheese, and our server explained there was an extra charge for it. That is something that I always appreciate.

"Futo Buta is to ramen what Charlotte is to authentic NY bagels or pastrami. When your best is just not good enough. Stopped in yesterday and ordered the smoked pork belly buns and Tonkotsu ramen. First, the pork belly rolls didn't have a spongy light texture, they were closer to a biscuit texture than a roll. The pork itself was nothing to write home about - most of the fat was rendered off causing it to be quite dry. The ramen is only as good as the broth that comprises its base. Futo's didn't have that silky unctuous flavor of a protein meat base, more like bone soup. The ramen noodles and mushrooms were the bright spots. David Chang - Charlotte needs you !",3,CpDp-S2j_9TmqHGstoudnA
I really wanted Pho but this was not good. The meat was tough and I paid $2 extra for one meatball. ONE meatball! I also ordered the pork plate which was just ok. The egg rolls were the best thing I had and they were just ok too! Very sad the pay over $30 and get this food,2,o0ADxb7vbd3c04IBcA0BVA

"I never write bad reviews, but I just couldn't help myself with this one.  They have a bunch of chain and some boutiquey type stores.   The only part I do love are the gorgeous palm trees and the sitting areas in the middle of the malls.   Other than that this place if for a bunch of snots, and show-and-gos.  I went to several stores and restaurants after it opened thinking it would get better. The last time I went, another customer dropped a heavy object on my foot in store and laughed with no concern and went back amongst her group of friends/family to further laugh, and the store employee asked if I was ok and did nothing.  I limped away, got an novacaine injection in my foot later because of the pain.  I will NEVER return to this douchey overpriced, snob shop place.

"after visiting sincity vapor II i basically said screw it and was gonna keep smoking but this review isnt about them.

i checked yelp looking for other vape shops and this place popped up seems like they just opened. i was real apprehensive about vape shops in general so decided to call before i headed out. the owner answered the phone and i had a very good conversation with him that ended up with me coming down a few hrs later.

He was very knowledgeable, answered all my dumb questions without making me feel like an idiot and bottom line i walked out of there with a little less money and alot happier. i have now been back multiple times for juice, advise and just to hang out and bs and every time its the same. greeted as soon as i enter the door no matter how busy he is and they make you feel like you are old friends. 

this is a new store but they are adding new products regularly (mods, batteries, clearomizers etc) and new juice flavors all the time. they have complimentary wifi, tv, and coffee I have no reason to go to another store keep up the good work.

I loved the cute little red wagons each customer gets to pull all through the store. You can get a plastic floor cover as you exit the door to avoid any spills on your ride home. 

Also if you're ever curious about what low maintenance house plants to get, I recommend aloe Vera plants, snake plants, a spider plants and golden Pothos.",4,t7CfIvIAqJZ16XdLUuA69Q

"Gyu-Kaku is an classy Japanese BBQ restaurant with great service, a fantastic happy hour, and mid range prices.  For those of you who have not been to a Japanese BBQ, think of those AYCE Korean BBQ places, but with better cuts of meats that are individually laid out on a tray rather than plopped in a bowl.  

I arrived earlier than my group, so I sat at the bar for a beer.  The happy hour was $2.50 draft beers and I took full advantage of it!  Our group sat at a booth - they've designed the restaurant to maximize booth space, cause you know, no one likes to sit close to a stranger.  They also air vents built right into the grill, so all the smoke gets sucked out before it even floats upwards.  Now, while you won't go home reeking of smoke, you also won't get the delightful smells of BBQ here as well.  

We ordered two of their group sets, which I love.  It takes the work of picking the individual meats and sides out of my hands.  Food just magically appears!

Overall, I highly recommend Gyu-Kaku if you're looking for a nice place to have a BBQ dinner.",4,cV9qGVYqOQ-op76T30m4jw

"Technically located inside an Asian market (but with their own store front--similar to Subways inside Wal-marts) this place serves up decent, Filipino munchies.

FILIPINO MUNCHIES
Although it doesn't taste like you've slipped into a Filipino family's kitchen and dined in secret on their creations, our desserts were still satisfying especially with the hot sun melting us outside. There was a slight chemical aftertaste in our selections--a small reminder this restaurant was in the business of making mass-produced, similar goodies in other locations. My Taho and our hot items didn't look very appealing in its disposable container--it looked like a rushed job of grabbing to-go containers from a birthday party.

GLANCING AROUND
Our cashier was very friendly, but with so many bodies dancing behind the counter, it was no surprise to witness some confusion in the interactions between the employees and the customers before and after my order. The dining area is very simple and plain--reminiscent of the old, old fast food places before they decided to upgrade.

I believe this place will stay busy from the mere belief most of its patrons are visiting Filipinos who want something somewhat reminiscent of home.",3,ZUrYvKWpX6-SwDsb8w2HWg

"Ridiculously under reviewed on Yelp. Everybody go to Debu's STAT!

I am pretty stingy with doling out stars, but this place is worth every star. Why can't it be downtown, closer home so I can go every week?

The place is not very spacious, so I made reservations and we were promptly seated by a pleasant hostess. The menu is well picked, the flavors are huuuge,and the food presentation is great! The hostess doubles up as a server so at times the service can be a tad slow but totally worth the wait.

We started off with fritters, and boy was I surprised! The fritters came in casings made of pappadoms and were garnished with a smattering of sauces and salts. The complimentary mango salsa is a take home worthy product! So good!

My dining partner ordered the vegetarian sampler which had a grilled cauliflower, a cheese dumpling aka kofta and delicious lentils! I ordered the non vegetarian platter which had jumbo shrimp cooked three different ways: grilled, in coconut sauce and in mustard. Each prep was so different from the other and so, so good. The combination of traditional spices in non traditional ways resulted in uniformly great flavors.

We weren't sure about ordering dessert cuz we were stuffed at this point, but the server gave us a complementary dessert platter which had cheese cake made out of cottage cheese(very decadent and I've never had this before); blueberries, and gelato ( I think). The ensuing food coma was one of the best I've ever had.

Dinner for two came to $80 with tip and tax (but sans alcohol and with complimentary dessert). Worth every penny.",5,ND_nEloP6bzKr5oCjLH2hQ

I sent the eggs back twice. I ordered over medium and both times they were less cooked than over easy. 

The breakfast potatoes were soggy when they should've been crisp. Definitely taken out of a warming tray. 

The pancakes which was the whole reason we came here were tough! I couldn't cut thru them with a fork and i had to stop eating after 1 bite because chewing the hard shell was too much for me. 

Coffee was only refilled once. For a breakfast that costs $30, I expect it to be fresh. And I got something less than that. 

I finally settled on eating the soggy potatoes after he took my eggs away. I gave the pancakes away to my fiancé. His omelet was bland at best.",2,3OunPeAI8icn3Vz-WsXpsw
"Man, I was disappointed considering this place had an average of 4 stars! I frequently visit Yi-Mei and Noodle Pot so maybe I have already found the gem's of Chinatown/Taiwanese food. The beef noodle soup is ok, but there was only one noodle choice. We also got the pork rice plate. Another Yelper also wrote this and we had the same problem...isn't that pork supposed to be fried on a rice plate? It wasn't a deal breaker but just a little strange. The food was just so-so and our table was dirty when we sat down. This place needs to be seen by the health dept and needs more sanitizer in their sanitizer bucket.",2,wqDkOedGzvsvNyopDyBGMg
"Just finished a productive and delicious working lunch at Cantina Laredo at Tivoli Village. The salmon chimichurri lunch special and service were  fantastic. 

I took note of the Thursday night lady's night with half price Margaritas. They have some unique and creative twists on traditional margaritas. Yum! 

Free Wi-Fi makes it a great place for business. Big thanks to the day manager that really went above and beyond in gracious service.",5,N7Q_IcnqEVa3VSyb_KKtMQ
"I purchased a groupon awhile back when they first opened and I'm finally getting around to using it. This place is located in a very small strip mall behind the gas station. The Christmas lights strung in the window is what caught my eye and led me here. 

We were warmly greeted by a husband and wife team. We were the only diners at the time, he gave us a very thorough run down of the menu items and had suggested the CC Sizzle, we picked Nacho Style. This was delicious. It was a blend of meat with onions, cabbage and cheese over their homemade tortilla chips. Our second item was the Green Chile Enchiladas, made with Hatch green chili's and chicken with creamy chili's sauce. I couldn't decide which one I liked more. 

We ended the meal with Sopaipillas. Probably one of the best I've ever tasted. I like mine with honey, and they had a few different types to choose from. 

This place is really casual. Even if you're dining in, your food is served in styrofoam to go container. The soda fountain wasn't working when we were there, bummer, I like a nice cold Coke when I'm eating Mexican food (only time I like soda). The owners were really nice, he was telling us all about where they're from in NM. I'm definitely planning to return and try some of their other dishes.",4,JKqCTG6FVg4SZDXkZnE4jg

Had Great service,better sandwiches,and an amazingly creative menu,That was equally delicious.they have homemade soups that change from day to day,I tried both a ham Brie and apple pressed sandwich,and a chicken salad that was probably the best I've ever had.(hope my mom doesn't see this) great atmosphere right on Main Street.",5,mV8gpepDVR9iB5CPHoDuOQ
"We decided on this place for dinner because it was in our hotel and there were reservation times available. Everything was okay, nothing blew my mind other than the two sauces that came with the steaks - red wine and peppercorn. We had the seafood appetizer, chili cheese fries, 14 oz sirloin with the ultimate Mac&Cheese, filet and lobster, and chicken. Our sirloin was cooked well but had a lot of chewy fat and gristle. The chili cheese fries and the mac&cheese both came out a little differently than expected but were good. The prices were typical Vegas prices, higher than the quality of the food in this case. But overall it was a good experience with good service.",3,4KZTn-chR05JSbVmKHw4lA
Voicemail full at times when called to scheduled. Left several messages on a voicemail to schedule. Never heard back. Not good business. Told Amazon local about my problems with this business and it was nice to get my money back in an unused voucher.,1,USmso7v-3zrBZVoJcKHoNQ

"I'll start by saying I love a deep tissue massage and often times just need one to feel better in my body... I had a gift card to Sol Escape and was excited for my appointment.  I went in the evening and at that time of day, I'm typically exhausted from my 2 small children... I had an appointment with Al, he was so nice and asked me questions about what I needed out of a massage.  He suggested Ashiatsu, which I had never heard of actually... I also missed the memo that he'd actually use his feet at times... all I know is- it was the best massage I have ever had!  The hot stones were amazing, and all I could think about was coming back in the winter for another one!  Don't be weirded out about feet- like I said, I had no idea until it was over.  You will miss out on the best massage ever if you overthink this!  My only suggestion would be to have the client choose between 2 scents with the oils.  The oil he used was fine during the massage, but when I left, I wasn't as much of fan.  Thanks so much to Al- you're amazing!",5,pmlYsMzXMRvUKi-hmI45ww

"Honestly, this place doesnt even amount to one star. I hated my first experience at Miss Korea but still decided to give it a second chance. I was so wrong to do that. First of all why are all the waitresses wearing street clothes? At least have an apron around ur waist?? The wait for the food was way too long and during the wait they didnt even bring us water, I had to ask for it. Also, that button on the table? Ya it doesnt work. Why is it even there if its not going to be functioning properly?? The food was honestly too expensive, around 20 dollars for a few pieces of ribs. This was also the first korean restaurant that didnt have appetizers and the funnier thing was that when we asked about the appetizer the waitress seemed to be in awe that we expect side dishes from a korean restaurant... A few days later I come back wanting to give them another chance. I asked for a pork bone soup, they were out of that, I asked for their bbq ribs they were out of that too and mind you it was 8pm when I went there and they close at 2:45am. I then asked the waitress what she recommends and she says the beef tofu soup. The soup literally had 3 small pieces of beef and a few pieces of tofu!!! And my friend ordered bibimbap, this was also my first time seeing bibimbap in a regular bowl rather than a stone pot. Do yourself a favour and dont waste your time and money at this place.",1,QnbuUgEtAuJpwGyEQ0hmRQ
"Great selection with extremely helpful staff. They have a nice mix of new and old fragrances for both men and women. I would highly recommend this store to any of my peers! Why pay retail when you can get them for a lot less. I will say all the fragrances I have ever bought from this location are all authentic, I haven't had any problems with them being ""watered"" down which some people claim such companies do.",5,0eXbLh1vt8ycJeDNtYTPNg

"This a chain. You know what they have, you know the price point, no big surprises there. There are so many chain pharmacies in Charlotte and they seem to do very little to differentiate themselves from one another.
 
Thankfully, I only have one prescription I have to deal with and just have to go by once a month. But, on that monthly trip I'm immediately irritated if I go inside. Generally I'm the only person at the Rx counter and there are 2-4 employees working. No one acknowledges you for at least 1-2 minutes; it's like they have a timer and can't speak before it goes off. Then, all they say is ""Be right with you"".  When someone does finally ask your name they dig through, find your Rx, make you sign the insurance book and cash you out with no more words. It's really amazing how little communication goes on. 

The drive-thru pickup, if it doesn't have a long-line is slightly better for some reason. Not personable at all but at least a bit quicker. 
I'm really just rather meh about the place and wish there was a local pharmacy that took my insurance.",2,5M8O5bYiCj6Kp1Nb7R8dtg

Disappointed and heart broken to say the least......................I brought in my healthy 5 year old Shar-Pei for a routine teeth cleaning and simple entropian surgery and left with a dead Shar-Pei. I do understand there can be complications with anesthesia but when you are giving 2 different stories about what happened then it becomes concerning. My dog had prior anesthesia numerous times without incident (NOT at this vet's office). The prices are very reasonable but I do think you get what you pay for and unfortunately my dog paid the ultimate price. I would never recommend this vet or bring so much as a goldfish to this office.,1,1yIi6DNBgh01KLWm_9XUBQ
"WORST Vegas hotel EVER! Room had an iPod-capable system, but did not have enough connectors for every room, so no personal music. Radio was broken and they did not replace it, so no music at all. Did not even have an alarm clock radio in room. TV reception was broken where half of the tv would freeze on a commercial during the show. Air conditioning blew up, leaving our entire room (beds and bags) covered in dust chunks. Maid service NEVER showed up, even after two complaints!

Managers are awful. Talked to one manager who said all he could do was give us room service in our dust-filled room that had still yet to be cleaned, even the next day! The second manager was just as useless. I called front desk to talk to him again and they put me on hold for 20 minutes, then sad he would call me back. Never got the call. 

You know the hotel is absolutely horrible when the people that work there laugh about how many complaints they get and say that the hotel (that employs them) sucks.

We would have been better off staying in a shit box that knows it's a shit box, rather than pretending to be decent.",1,s59B3zmgo5aZDhYqOBMsNg
"Piccolo forno is, hands down, the best value for food in the city that I have come across. I've been half a dozen or more times since I moved to Pitt and Piccolo Forno has never disappointed me. If you've never been before, at least one person at your party should order the marscapone y speck pizza to share with the group. It is simply delightful.

Portions are extremely reasonable- I'm a normal sized, younger man and I'll eat 6/8 slices at dinner and not leave hungry. Prices feel extremely low (13-15) for a pizza of such insanely high quality. BYOB makes this place the highest value restaurant I can think of. 

The only downside of the restaurant is that they do not take reservations. They will, however, call you so what I've always done- either in a group of 2, 3, 4, or 6, is to place the reservation and head across the street to round corner cantina to enjoy a drink while we wait. I recommend you do the same as the wait will often be 30-50 minutes if you arrive during prime time.",5,gAG2dZ5fpi_IjkIQkHXdNQ

"Al was great! He was honest, friendly, and professional. He made sure I knew he had coupons online specifically for the maintenance flushes I wanted to do on my car. He was good about explaining any concerns he had on my car and when I wanted to get a certain filter changed, he looked into it and told me I actually didn't need to change it. I also liked how he wrote out price quotes for things he felt like needed to be changed so you can see exactly how much things will cost and no ""dooms day"" picture if you don't get it changed right away to scare you into doing something. Funny enough, another customer had brought her car in for inspection to renew her tags and he told her they weren't actually due until March 2014, not March 2013 as she thought and he was happy to send her on her way if she wanted to wait on it. Really happy with his service and will definitely come back!",5,HFKueHE0WJqBY1aMRXVAfg

"We were staying at a hotel nearby and found the reviews for this spot. Boy are we glad that we did! We are constantly on the hunt for great tacos in any city, this was definitely one for our list. 
We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best. 
Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Fresca's ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side.",4,ItSS722u2glIUmc_bPxGPg
"My favorite Shoppers location among the four I pass between my work and home.

Pros:
- bigger & better organized than most
- has the most helpful (and generous with samples!) beauty consultants
- postal office staff are great too (something you know is a rare occurrence if you go to the other locations nearby)
- rarely run out of sale items, a frequent occurrence at the smaller locations
- a large food section makes it a good spot to stock up on staples (milk is cheaper here than at the supermarket)
- they sell TTC tokens

Cons:
-  I'm not a fan of the pharmacy because a) the pharmacist isn't very knowledgeable about things like supplements and non-prescription items and b) it's overpriced (but that's not a location specific complaint - all Shoppers are).",4,kicmIJvfo2sypNZaCr6jiA

"...the Saturday Market is awesome - except for the baked goods from Vincent's.  A $2.50 Almond Croissant that was 1/2 the size of my palm, lacking in flavor, and ice cold?  No.  Sorry.  No.  As a matter of fact, it was the worst almond croissant I have ever eaten.

The bread pudding was slightly better and the duck and pork tamales are actually quite good.  The overall ""Saturday Market"" is a nice place, but the products from Vincent's Market Bistro only make me wish I'd have just gone to Tammie Coe, La Grande Orange, or so many others instead.",2,jdGQl9_ZR08bnOaIS0TYMQ
"Clive understands that even grumpy vegan ladies want greasy nosh and partytimes with their homies. They also understand that said grumpy vegan ladies do not, in fact; enjoy a grey bean-y discus that has been microwaved, until hateful and rubbery. 

For all these things, Clive has won a place in my heart. Pile all the toppings you want on a vegan burger ~*that actually tastes mouthwatering*~, or a cow burger (I won't judge you, I promise... O_o) at no extra charge! The only extras they charge you for are a fried egg and bacon. Take your Celiac friend to a burger joint, without fear of the cops showing up at your door later that evening to arrest you for attempted murder! Personable, friendly (and attractive!) staff, that nudge you toward the vegan - not veggie burger (the veggie burger uses eggs as a binder) because they genuinely want you to have the best experience at their establishment possible. 

The only thing I didn't fall in love with were Clive's fries. The ones at the top of the bag I received, were delicious! But after breaking that first layer; the rest were too salty, gummy and greasy. Sorry, Clive. Maybe if I had spread them out, like the ladybee next to me, they wouldn't have gotten so chewy? I'll give them another try next time, because I hella love potatoes. I do love that they are generous with them, so on my next visit I'll take a cue from other reviewers and split an order with a homie. 

Love the atmosphere, the adorable drawings of food everywhere - even on the staff tees; the commitment to having a simple and locally sourced menu, and being environmentally friendly. Thanks for existing, Clive!",5,s1OI7_WMZfWdSZFUVqCz3g
"I just got back from my first trip to the Stratosphere. I had a Select room and I totally loved the place!

Just the right amount of crowded, outstanding service by everyone I encountered, and I didn't feel like I was constantly being ripped off like most other strip places. Played volleyball at the pool, ate at Roxy's (2x) and McCall's Heartland Grill...both had gluten free options for the wife too. Saw the Frankie Moreno show for free, which was one of the best show's I've seen. Lots of bars, restaurants, and stuff to do. Also the area outside the hotel was fine during the day, and will probably continue to get better when SLS and Walgreens opens.

Strat has won a spot in my hotel rotation.",5,6FI42UWDI0mOC5UPtTUGgw

"I have been taking my car to the Bethany Home Rd. and 7th Street location for many years. I always worked with George the Manager who is now no longer there unfortunately. George was always great, helpful, friendly and seemed to be very honest in what repairs needed to be done.

I took my car there last week for an oil and filter change. I dropped off my car with Mike who was not friendly at all, seemed pre-occupied with whatever other work he was doing and I felt like he truly wasn't listening to me when I talked to him about what I needed done.

When I picked up my car, I spoke to Scott who was at least a bit nicer and he went through and explained what their suggestions were for future car repairs and the pricing but I still didn't get a great feeling from him that I would be taken care. I had my breaks done there sometime back so it will be time to get them replaced soon and since they are on a lifetime warranty, all I would need to pay for is the labor which he said would be $60. Since he quoted me a price last week, I naturally thought that information would be saved in the computer system for when I was ready to get it worked on. 

Today, I called to confirm the price and make an appointment to take my car in. Mike answered and at first quoted me $139.99. I then said that Scott had quoted me a different amount. Mike then quoted me $70.00. I again said that that was not the amount Scott had quoted me. At that time, he asked what Scott had quoted me and I told him $60.00. He said if Scott quoted me that then they'd honor it. What I don't understand is, why wasn't Scott's original quote already in the system in my file? Why am I being given another 2 higher quotes? If I'm a ""valued customer"" why am I not given the correct and lower quote right away? And furthermore, how am I supposed to trust what they are telling me is correct on what needs to be done? I hate playing this game and shouldn't have to for a place that I've been going to for years. It's quite frustrating.",1,mugyiYb0zHpDtKvWEObUPA

"What a fantastic and informative food tour. Not only did we get a good variety of food to try, but we got an excellent history lesson about Montreal from our tour guide, Kim.

We rolled into the Mile End food tour as a group of 10 and were joined by 2 other couples, rounding out our tour group number at 14 people. I won't go too in-depth at all of our stops, but i would highly recommend this tour, based on how our guide took us from stop to stop and passionately described the food we were eating and the history behind it. We made stops at the following locations:

La Panthere Verte - for falafel
Chocolats Genevieve Grandbois - for chocolate tasting
St-Viateur Bagel - for Montreal bagel tasting
Rialto Theatre - to tour the former movie palace
Drogheria Fine - for Gnocchi
Boucherie Lawrence - for meat-tasting
Kem Comba - for ice cream

To summarize, all of the food and snacks were fantastic. Not a single disappointment in what we were served at each stop or the information we were given. If I had to do it again, I wouldn't change a thing as not only did we get a full meal and more with Kim, but as I stated earlier, she was excellent in explaining to us the history of the city.",5,zxPqHaNcDlwwVJLDwkRPGg

"Very excited to hear about the new lobster food truck in town, we were disappointed to miss their debut at Millvale food truck park and promptly signed up with their instagram account so we could cyber stalk their next location. 

We looked forward to meeting for lunch at their location  in the strip district all week long and got there with eager anticipation. Luckily for us, they did not disappoint! We had studied their menu online beforehand so we could game plan what we would order and share. 

We ordered one cold served Maine style lobster roll, one warm served Connecticut style lobster roll and their lobster tater tots. On the way down, we stopped at a Get Go for some Iron City Light beers to accompany lunch because you need some ""bee-ah"" for your ""lobstah"" rolls. I wish they had forks for their lobster tater tots because it was pretty impossible to eat without one with all that was going on, but I managed.

I have received 2 emails back that said we had to wait for a managers call back and had a nasty tone. I have called 4 times, left messages, but the employees said that the managers never call back and that they wait people out so they don't have to fix anything. I also was told that there was no managers on duty each time I called. DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SHIESTERS.",1,QBH-AcO0THYS6AZVCT6Yng
"I returned at Reggie's last night, and was sober this time with clarity of mind and tastebuds.  So memory did serve me right.  The poutine here is pretty good, both buzzed and sober!

A friend & I split the Regular Poutine w/ Chicken Gravy ($5) and the Pulled Pork Poutine w/ Goat Cheese & BBQ Sauce ($6.50).  The regular is the better of the two in my book.  I would definitely stick with that.  My friends liked the pulled pork one better.  I admit the pulled pork was good and not characteristically dry like how most pulled pork is.  However, the pulled pork poutine pales in comparison to the original regular poutine.  Goat cheese & BBQ sauce can't replace the fatty A magic of cheese curds & gravy.  Reggie's uses chicken gravy, which is very good.  This might possibly be my favorite poutine place.

I hear their Monte Cristo is good.  If I'm willing to wean myself off of poutine, maybe I'll try it one day.",4,MunD6zk9nqu9zLkvlGhe2A
"Ever since my bf recently discovered frozen yogurt (yeah, he's a little slow to jump on the bandwagon), we've been trying different yogurt places around town. I usually get dragged to a yogurt dessert after eating ridiculously large meals, so thank goodness it's lower in fat! I'm 5'6"" and trying to keep up with a 6'2"" man's metabolism here. 

Yogurtland has been our favorite. They have an excellent selection with a wide variety of flavors and toppings. We tried a bunch of flavors and both ended up doing a strawberry/cheesecake mix with strawberries, blueberries, and walnuts on top. We also added a few of their little cheese cake bites. Their yogurt's taste and texture is perfect.  

When the cashier rang us up, we thought she had only totalled one of our yogurts by accident.... could it be only $6 for two pretty fully loaded cups of yogurt?? Normally, ONE yogurt runs us $5-6. Not only is it good, it's cheap too?! That gets my stamp of approval.",4,GGlHpbt_cGL7akMEDKxcyw
"What amazing customer service!  I visit Vegas about once a year.  I always stop here, always buy something, and always receive AMAZING service!  This time my sister and I had the good fortune to work with Christina F.  Turns out she is dating Joe who helped us last year (and was amazing) although he has moved on to the real estate industry.  Christina actually remembered us from last year and was so much fun.  We bought several things and then my sister mentioned a DY bracelet she had (purchased at Saks) where stone had fallen out a couple of days prior.  Christina was all over it and told my sis to bring in the next day and they would send off for replacement.  Wow!  I love this place.  I'm not gonna buy Yurman any place but here.  Oh, and did I mention that on Saturday they had a DJ?  And they have beverages and snacks?  We didn't indulge in bubbly until after we made our purchases, just to be sure we did it with sound mind.  :)",5,Dd_xbca8TsW7zfWP09crCA

"I've been here on several occasions for lunch and some late night meals when I've been downtown.  They have a rather small restaurant, and during the lunch hours it can get fairly packed.  The restaurant is tactfully decorated to match it's ethnic background.  

The menu here is fairly simple with some basic but creative dishes.  My favorite by far has been the spicy basil fried rice with chicken.  It is spot on with some vegetables and rice as well as having a good amount of kick to it.  If you aren't a huge fan of heat, you can choose to have a lower heat level for any dish.  Last time I was here, my wife ordered pineapple rice with chicken.  She thoroughly enjoyed it which had some sizable chunks of pineapple and other vegetables.  The only complaint I would have is I've noticed a less than ideal amounts of chicken in the dishes.  Other than that, the portion typically is more than a single meal.

This is a cool place to have some good Thai food.  If you are nervous about trying Thai, but enjoy rice dishes, this will be a great place to start! I've also had their pad Thai here and it was extremely excellent.  Not a bad price for a downtown meal and their service, food, and staff has been very consistent.",4,u6t2lrT4O4wA_KpopNk5Sg
"Went there with some friends from out of town and had a good time. Since my friend worked for the company and I knew the GM this review will be a little biased. We had the lobster tacos, calamari, rock shrimp and some tuna for appetizers. I had a excellent sirloin that came with two types of sauces on the side a au poive pepper sauce and a red wine sauce that were both delicious. others in the party ordered the Salmon and Sea Bass that looked great. For side dishes we had the creamy spinach, lobster mashed potatoes  and sauteed mushrooms they seemed a little salty by themselves but with the steak it evened out nicely. For dessert we had the fried donuts that came with a banana and chocolate sauce. Not the cheapest meal to be had but certainly one of the best. I liked the atmosphere in the place it had a nice modern feel to it and the wavy wood panel ceiling was cool. Plus I was told they like hiring hostesses that are tall :)",4,5AYTnEyHgjTpMlewL0z1Nw

Let me say that it is extremely difficult to find trustworthy landscaping company in Las Vegas, NV.  Managing a property from hundreds of miles away, I've had other companies flake or take payments and not perform services.

David and Tammy at Sun Scape Services are awesome!  I've been working in property management for over 20 years with some of my properties being outside of my home state (this being one of them).  I cannot begin to tell you how difficult it is to find a reputable landscaping/lawn service company in the Las Vegas area.  They really are a dime a dozen and some of them are fly by night.

"Interesting place to say the least. The owner will ask if you know what you are looking for. If you don't you'll have to leave $3 on the counter. You'll be asked to leave if you don't and she'll only give the money back if you buy something.

Now the bookstore: She has a decent collection of French and English books, but nothing rare, exotic or particularly cheap (quite the opposite in fact). Unfortunately the only book that caught my attention was also in terrible condition.",2,TPG_UHaZ6xzkYDwtul3zqw
When we arrived the hostess prompted us to sit at the first table in the bar area (near the front door/ host podium) As its 40 degrees outside tonight I was a little annoyed that the two hostesses working propped the front doors open to bring in all of the outside cushions from the chairs and let the guests inside or near the door freeze.

The drinks were strong and our waitress was on top of her game. I dont know if this place will make it, since it never looks crowded but i hope it does..",4,371Wbr8ue8X7tvTwPuIthw
"Went there last night for dinner.  

What I liked was the fish, not too greasy and tasted good.  

What I didn't like was
* services was impersonal - didn't offer water, didn't check in if I wanted a refill on my pop or if the food was ok.
* fries were bland, maybe not that fresh.  Could have been frozen
* garlic cheese bread was almost like a hot dog bun opened up with cheese and garlic (over priced)
* washrooms was super small (two small for more then one person - should be a private washroom) and smelled like bleach.  At least wait till the restaurant is closed before throwing bleach down everywhere.

Not running back there anytime soon. Maybe next time I'll do take out.  Too bad as they have a liquor licence and I like to drink.",2,jOExIeF5jnQuX-duBDyXrw
"I love Gordon Ramsay and was really excited to try this restaurant and would have sooner if reservations were 2 months out for a decent time on weekends (That's always a good sign). Our reservation was Sunday 4/15 at 8:15 pm for my husband's birthday dinner.

Our waiter Ott (Ongart) was awesome! He made great recommendations and had extensive knowledge of the menu. You could really tell he actually enjoys his job and where he works. I highly recommend requesting him as your waiter when making reservations.

We ordered shrimp cocktail which had a seasoning on it, smoked golden beets that had a dramatic presentation, braised short rib were tender, brick chicken was moist, roasted cauliflower which was different, wild mushrooms that was flavorful and the signature sticky toffee pudding that is always good.

 Everything was amazing. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Portion were fantastic and exceeded our expectations. Definitely worth the wait.",5,HgYIvU-TpnxE-zRxcEv01g

"I came here for a Winterlicious lunch with a large group of friends, and was pretty underwhelmed with my experience here. While the restaurant does look pretty nice (high windowed ceilings, lots of natural light, etc.), the food and service are both just kind of mediocre.

Appetizer: Goat Cheese Flat Bread (sundried tomato pesto, arugula, fresh basil, fire roasted red peppers). I ordered this because I love goat cheese and arugula, and it tasted just fine. The flat bread was a bit harder than I expected though, like I kind of forgot it was flat bread and felt like I was eating a cracker at times.

Main: Beef Bourguignon. This sounds really fancy, but really it's just like beef stew. I don't know if in reality it is actually supposed to be fancy, but the one at Trios was kind of a let down. I mean, you would expect there to be some variation in flavour, but ultimately the stew just tasted... salty. Like super salty. Apparently there were pearl onions, crimini mushrooms and double smoked bacon in the stew, but really, I have no recollection of any of that stuff. Really it was all just beef, salt, and mashed potatoes in my memories.

Dessert: Triple Cream Brie with fig preserve, spiced pecans and crostini. I actually really enjoyed this. The brie was not too strong in flavour and really was very creamy. It was delicious on its own as well as with the sweet fig preserve. This was definitely my favourite part of the meal.

Service: It seemed like the servers were trying... and they were all really nice, but I was confused. Considering the restaurant really was NOT busy, they were surprisingly absent for a lot of the time. Besides coming out to take our orders and bring us our food, for the most part they were nowhere to be seen. I remember this especially being a problem after we had all had our beef stews, and one of my friends specifically had to request to have our waters refilled because they were all low and we were all dying of thirst. Sooo can't say I was terribly impressed with this either.

Overall: Definitely a little disappointed - maybe a little bit less so if the lunch had been in the cheapest category ($18) but I don't think it was worth the $23 price tag we paid.",2,iXBAmcmatDXu3HebOyz-9w

The employees are cool. They all seem to get along and laugh together. Quick customer service indoor and drive thru.

Great value menu. I'll have one of each item :P for my slight fast food binge. Would you care for some brain freeze? There's frosted Coca Cola flavors! Yet another bonus, their soda fountain is a fun touch screen that dispenses a large fruit variety of Sprite! I tried peach! Yaaaaheheeyyyyy!

And the best part of your BK experience shall be...Chocolate candy themed pies! GET. IT.",4,E3vfQTy1iOH7QJ5KOkINWg
"Just okay.  

I liked my meal.  I had the gumbo soup, a great baked potato with lots of fixings, a sort of chocolate cheesecake dessert that was great.  My husband didn't like his meal.  My husband ordered a $50 steak that was fatty and gristley.  I could tell he was bummed when he poked around at his steak with furrowed eyebrows, cutting off piece after piece of inedible meat.

  I was really hoping to please him since it was his birthday.  I let them know when I made the reservations well in advance that it was his birthday and we didn't get a birthday dessert or anything free like you do at most other restaurants.  They remembered it was his birthday, the hostess (who was pleasant and very friendly) gave him a cheery happy birthday as we were going to be seated.  I really expect a little something special if we are spending our special day at their establishment.

  The waitstaff was prompt and friendly.  They seemed to linger around and dive right in when you need a refill on your drink, or in my case another great martini.  I almost forgot to mention that I loved their martinis.  

Will we return?  Definitely no.  There are way more better restaurants in Vegas.  The atmosphere is a big blah (with the exception of the impressive suits that the friendly waitors wear), the food was just okay/slightly better than average, and the prices higher than they should be for the quality.",3,_inbJx1g8OwOWhXAmsfNaQ

"This review is solely for my friend's wedding reception, which was great. 5 stars for the bartender, who if he judged me for alternating between manhattans and dirty martinis all night didn't let on, he just kept my glass full. They had lots of passed hors d'oeuvres at the start of the reception, and while I appreciated the variety, some were really great and others were just so-so. The lamb chops and the lobster wontons were stand-outs. Dinner was steak, and I think it was alright, but thanks to the martinis and manhattans, I don't remember many details about the dinner. There was karaoke at the reception, which was kind of awesome, only complaint is that the DJ was really cheesy, even compared to other wedding DJs.",4,4U-hVwZ77oHuVxMH0V1G6w

"L'hôtel est situé à l'angle de Ste Catherine et de St Laurent, 2 artères incontournables à Montréal pour qui veut magasiner ou veut sortir.
A 2 pas de la place des Arts, c'est donc l'emplacement idéal pour qui veut profiter des festivals. Revers évident, vous en profiterez de toutes façons ! Par confort, j'ai opté pour des bouchons d'oreilles et cela a suffi à rendre mes nuits plus silencieuses ( à 4$ les 5 paires, l'investissement n'était pas ruineux).
L'accès est très facile : le bus de l'aéroport et le métro arrivent à un bloc de distance (mais pas le même :-) ). 

En arrivant à pied à l'hôtel, vous aurez peut-être remarqué quelques théâtres pour adultes. Il y a effectivement quelques mètres de trottoirs consacrées aux plus de 18 ans, et le voisinage de l'hôtel ne fait pas exception. Cependant, il n'y a rien de malsain dans cet entourage : après tout, on est au cœur de la ville.

La réception est située au premier étage, escalier obligatoire. Nous avons été très bien accueillis avec un enregistrement rapide assorti de nombreux conseils et de la documentation indispensable pour commencer notre séjour.
Nous avions opté pour une chambre économique avec salle de douche commune. La surface modeste de la chambre était compensée par un haut plafond et un grand placard, nous n'étions donc pas encombrés par nos bagages. 

Il y avait 3 salles de douche pour l'étage. Elles étaient nettoyées plusieurs fois dans la journée et je ne me suis jamais retrouvée à attendre. Ce n'est qu'à de rares occasions que j'ai trouvé des traces indiquant le passage d'autres hôtes, alors même que l'hôtel était plein.
Le wifi ne passe pas très bien dans les étages. Comme la chambre était juste au-dessus de la réception, nous avons pu en profiter. Autrement, les fauteuils de la réception vous accueilleront pour votre surf.
Pour le petit déjeuner, je crois que l'hôtel a un accord avec un restaurant tout proche. De notre côté, nous avons préféré profiter des nombreux cafés de Montréal.

En conclusion, si vous recherchez le silence et le design, vous serez certainement frustrés. Par contre, si vous recherchez une position centrale, un hôtel propre et simple avec un accueil sympa et chaleureux, je ne peux que vous conseiller l'Abri du voyageur qui porte très bien son nom.",4,IGs9YOaXvWyaOQVKvPToEw

"After a long hard day at the office,  some BBQ wings sounded great. I found Alt Wings and the reviews looked great so here we are.  

The staff was very friendly and helped us with a recommendation which was 12 wings and french fry's and how cool we got a free soda.  

I loved the crushed ice they use instead of big cubes you find everywhere else.

The wings were deep fried and crispy.  The flavor was amazing and there was lots of BBQ sauce on the wings.  Very tasty and filling. 5 stars on the wings.

The frys were very tasty and not the typical frys you get at a fast food restaurant .  The only reason I gave 4 stars is there was way too much salt on the frys.  MAKE SURE TO TELL THEM LIGHT SALT and you will give them 5 stars for sure.

I will be back for sure.",4,wzbeeYfuhbJMD0htpBBYwQ
"Il y a un mois et demi quand nous sommes venus entre Yelpeurs, j'étais prête à donner trois étoiles mais après mon expérience de ce soir, j'augmente à quatre étoiles. Je m'explique.

Thème: Marocain 

Le premier service, le gâteau de foie gras. Beau moyen d'impressionner la galerie. Les deux fois, ont été une expérience incroyable. Le mélange de saveurs sucrées, acides et salées, c'est la décadence dans toute sa splendeur. Ensuite sont servis en même temps la tajine de boulettes de saumons avec petits pois et avocats, les calmars bouillis et farcis avec du porc un peu épicé et une leur version de porchetta avec une petite salade et des oreilles de christ soufflées. Bon, mais sans plus. Ensuite vient l'omelette. À ma première visite celle-ci était servie dans un vol-au-vent vent à l'encre de sèche avec des aubergines et une béchamel blanche et une béchamel à l'encre de sèche. J'ai personnellement vraiment pas aimé. Cette fois ci, ce plat avait été remplacé par une omelette bien soufflée avec un gros tas de bon bacon caramélisé à l'érable. Grosse grosse amélioration. Tout le monde a adoré. Ensuite sont venu les tanjia. Une sucrée et une salée. La sucrée, c'était une réussite les deux fois. La salée était 100 fois meilleure cette fois-ci comme ils ont ajouté du citron. Pour accompagner la viande, avant, ils donnaient un genre de cake de carottes avec les fèves blanches à l'intérieur et personne à aimé. On voulait même pas en rapporter dans nos doggy bags. Ils ont remplacé ce plat par une genre de bouillie bien épicée de fèves blanches avec des carottes caramélisées dans le sirop d'érable. Mega upgrade, jai adoré. Tout ça servi avec une bonne miche de pain maison.

Les desserts, quantité industrielle de desserts, soit la tire délicieuses dans un banc de granité à la menthe. Pour moi, c'est ce dessert qui l'emporte. Aussi, des crêpes aux mandarines flambées au Cointreau, une crème glacée sur un genre de gâteau au dates (je crois), de l'écorce avec crème et chocolat blanc et deux différentes pâtes d'amandes, une frite et l'autre au sucre à la crème. 

"" Props "" à eux qui ont fait un petit dessert sans lactose pour mon amie intolérante.

Well, I wish we hadn't.  The food was tasteless and bland.  I should have known right away we were in trouble when I saw how large the menu was.  It is all over the board with fried fish and flat bread pizza to street tacos.  

My wife had the spaghetti squash & zucchini.  She said it was terrible.  I had the cowboy burger and was not impressed at all.  The onion ribbons were cold and the bun was not very fresh.  Overall, just not very good at all.

"A pawn shop is not an establishment I ever thought I'd be writing a review for but, as they say, ""life happens."" It's not that I thought less of pawn shops, but I admit I had a preconceived notion of what a pawn shop experience might be. And let me tell you, I walked into a SuperPawn Cash America last night JUST to get a quote on a loan, and my preconceived notions were definitely confirmed-- I was low-balled-- they offered 10% of what I got from Max Pawn. Take my words with a grain of salt, but you definitely have a bunch of different apples around town and Max Pawn is the good one in the barrel. 

I've been to this location twice now, once to sell electronic accessories I didn't need and just wanted cash for (and was too lazy to try eBay for), and once, now, to get a loan to help me through a difficult time. I am the worst possible person when it comes to remembering names, but two really kind and professional gentlemen helped me out when it came to checking my gear out, then processing the loan. 

Times are tough, and Max Pawn offered me two friendly experiences with non-judgmental people. For pawn shop newbies, the interest rate for a month is still applicable if you pay them back in a day. I plan to be repaying the loan in two weeks, and am confident my items will be well-stored and safe until I return. 

Though kind of cheesy, I really want to thank the people here for allowing me to maintain some financial independence as I sort things out. Thank you so much! I will be sending you all as much business as I can. Your staff is awesome and your establishment is cleaner than a department store.

Check them out if you're on this side of town, and make an adventure out of it if you're not.",5,ueD8qM2urdvDjMTBqkVgXg

"It's been awhile since I've eaten at a Cracker Barrel.  I won't go back.  First off, you can't navigate through the ""store"" because there is so much crap and then people don't want to be considerate of others trying to get by.  Our server was wonderful, truly.  All the staff seemed great, but the food is so awful.  The menu boasts ""thick sliced bacon"".  The bacon is not thick sliced, I've had better from Wendy's on a cheeseburger.  The apple cinnamon oatmeal had two small slices of apple and I couldn't taste cinnamon at all.  The oatmeal was gummy.  Also, check your water filters because I kept having to add sugar and lemon to my hot tea to get the disgusting taste of metal or whatever to take a backseat to the actual flavor of tea.  No one else in my party said anything about their food, but they didn't seem too impressed.  I paid $50 for this meal (before tip).  Seriously?  I'll take my breakfast business to one of the local owned establishments and pay that price for food that is actually fresh and doesn't look like it came from a McDonald's.",1,Q9VgPX7niP0zuh9yVz9zJA
"Camp Randall might be the most fun stadium I've ever been to. And I've been to quite a few, including the Big House, the Superdome, the Horsehoe, and Death Valley in Baton Rouge. 
I came as a visitor and wasn't sure what to expect outside of jumping around after the 3rd quarter. 
Despite having lost and it being cold and wet, I had a blast. The atmosphere is amazing. The people are incredibly friendly and love talking football (especially trashing other schools in the B1G). 
I would go back to Madison in a heartbeat.",5,pPvFZeZW8LTFI34-5sAPbA
"I discovered this place when I was working for an extended period in Las Vegas. When I come back to Las Vegas, I usually stay elsewhere, but I come to the spa here. Other places are more luxurious and have more amenities, but I don't think you can beat Spa Orleans on value. The place is clean, very easy to schedule an appointment, only 3/4 of a mile from the strip. As my schedule is often in flux, I often don't call to schedule an appointment until the day before and I'm able to get in easily, even on weekends. I've had massages from two people here, one time with Joe and a couple of times with Debbie. Joe likes to talk. He'll tell you all about the famous people he's worked on over the years when he was at Caesar's. His Old Vegas stories are interesting, but I prefer less conversation. The other thing about Joe is he really works you over. I prefer gentle and more relaxing. After Joe, I felt like I needed a massage to recover from his massage!  I think Joe is in demand and has a loyal clientele, it was just a little too intense for me. I've had Debbie a couple of times and I now request her. Minimal conversation, gentle, relaxing. I go a half hour early, sit in the steam room for 15-20 minutes, shower, have my massage, hit the jacuzzi for a few minutes, clean up and leave. Most of the time the place isn't busy and I have it all to myself.",4,muxrS5Q0SRx9iPavrQ-DGw
"I had an amazing experience my first time in sugarcane! 
The host Victoria who graciously welcomed me with a big smile and positive attitude suggested I try the kinilaw Kampachi, goat cheese croquettes, and ribs. Well let me just say I'll be back again because those dishes were absolutely DELICIOUS and my server Aldana was well versed on the menu having a detailed answer for every question I threw her way. 

** I will add when you read the menu you should go in with an open mind and pick one thing you might not normally go for because it'll pleasantly surprise you! 

Great service all around thank you for a great lunch!",5,DkZrF85M_cXaaUOK1I2xcw
"I am wholly convinced that there is not another realtor in town who can do a better job than Laura. She has been unbelievably flexible, hard working, and kind. Those traits you don't often see wrapped together in a single person, but she exudes many more traits than just those I listed. She gives honest and reliable feedback, which is invaluable for a layman, like myself. Being a first time home buyer comes with a steep learning curve, and Laura has helped every step of the way with her pervasive knowledge and experience to ensure my husband and I are able to make informed decisions during this arduous process. Lastly, her positive attitude makes the whole process so much less daunting, and she has been an absolute pleasure to work with. She has truly made this home buying process an experience that my husband and I will look back on fondly from inside our beautiful home. 

Thank you, Laura!",5,uumJ8YYtquNsnEBp2_cuoA
"Cupcakes you could eat with a fork.

Perhaps the most dense, moist, and filling cupcakes I've ever had.  the buckeye has some sort of delicious peanut butter blend that gives you a lovely peanut butter compliment to the moist chocolate cake, but doesn't have your tongue sticking to the roof of your mouth.",4,qWDjgGwfgGhHkSOhWLpvng
"This place is on the higher end of my usual price range, but since it was close to my house and new, I wanted to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. The dinner menu was surprisingly deep. They certainly have something for everyone. The portions and the presentation made the higher price point easily justified. Combine that with the friendly staff and live entertainment, it was a wonderful experience. This is one of those places where the waitstaff makes you feel like you're a part of the family. I honestly will go back as much for the staff as I will for the food. Definitely worth a visit. 

NOTE- If you don't like cilantro, the meatloaf will not be for you. It's an interesting recipe that is fairly heavy on cilantro both inside the loaf and as a garnish.",4,Fvl6dLJLBQmMgdV1c476Fw
"I love BDS!  The staff and regulars are really what makes this place but they definitely have a little bit of everything.

Video poker, of course, as well as pool tables, darts, Golden Tee & shuffleboard, as well as TVs for sports - it draws a pretty good crowd for football games without being overtly packed.

On the plus side, they just opened a kitchen and the food is delicious!  Nothing too fancy, but so yum.  I'm sure it's about to get a lot busier at BDS in the near future...",4,vE4dV7vIOF0n763SJG3hbg
wow I love this place so much and it has the nicest staff ever. I came across a different cashier every time I came they are very helpful and kind and are so knowledgeable on the menu.

"Why is there only 5 stars in this freaking app?!?!
Let me tell you guys, I have always had 4 different insurance agents for my properties, vehicles, businesses, toys and all. It was such a headache and impossible to follow!
Until I met Cassidy and her awesome team!!! WOW, these guys are in top of it, always pricing out better options for me, on top of my payments and making sure I'm always current.
I would say the best thing is the personal care you get, it's as if they actually care about saving you every dime (even when you don't care for it) while maintaining a booklet proof insurance coverage for you and your loved ones.

I highly recommend Cassidy and her crew to anyone who owns anything ;)",5,39whhovFv9qYB5eMo0emIw
"I've seen this place a lot multiple times in passing but just went earlier this week and I was pleasantly surprised!
We had a pretty big group (10 people) so we made a reservation ahead of time. The place was actually really empty, which wasn't too surprising since it was a Tuesday evening.
The host was very accommodating with people from our group arriving late and ordering at different times. Can't remember his name but he was so helpful and patient the entire time.
The menu selection is pretty big! There's lots of Greek choices like pita, falafel, and souvlaki, as well as a variety of more Americanized options like pizza, pasta, calzones, sandwiches, and burgers. I had the Big Fat Greek Burger and it was a huuuuge portion. Like multiple toppings such as tomatoes and feta, with a burger patty AND plenty of gyro meat, plus it came with fries! Sooo much food.
The portions of other food looked pretty big too; other members of my group got lamb chops, Florentine pizza, calzone (which is also really big!), pasta, Greek nachos, and they all really enjoyed the food!
Plus it was happy hour so they had specials like $3 drinks, $4-5 appetizers, $19 pitchers of sangria, and I think they had half off bottles of wine that day.
Basically, if you're craving Greek food (or pizza/pasta) in Tempe, My Big Fat Grewk Restaurant is definitely worth a try!",4,Fon1nkACnFSZWAw0MHljXQ
"This place has been here for years. Very homey and it's like your in your grandma's kitchen! The owner is usually our server and very pleasent and attentive. There is usually not a lot of people here so you get extra attention which is nice. The food is very good, has good flavor and doesn't take to long. The only problem I have is that he seems to be a bit understaffed so I felt bad asking for bread that would usually come out before the meal. Husand had chicken marsala and it was excellent, I enjoyed my eggpalant. Not a five star place but it's definitely better then Olive Garden or Carrabas!",4,QmPP3DmYvUiCjDk7f2XQ3Q

"from the service to the food to the experience!! Went with a few co-workers for an after work dinner and had a good conversation time!

Our server was very helpful and personable but not pushy or too comfortable. He gave us suggestions and opinions to help us make our plate selections. 

We decided to do it family style to try a few plates..get the 30 hour pork belly!! We all shared and left feeling full and didn't break the bank!! 

Best of all..the experience. The ambiance was very comfortable and relaxing. There was a couple sitting next to us and it felt very perfect for them..a ""date night"" restaurant. The lights were dim and subtle and the music in the back round was of all genres but of a soothing and loving tune. 

I so suggest giving Moko a try!!",4,yyWGFzSp--9PE_5japf4IQ

"I've been to the Liberty a total of three times:

The first was during restaurant week- the highlight of my meal was a dessert that was a gooey chocolatey cake with a chocolate stout shooter...but its not on their regular menu and that makes me sad. 

The second I went for the Mac N Cheese - which was meh to say the least. I ended up exchanging it because I didn't care for it, dry, over-herbed which was strange because it almost was bland. 

Today I went with some coworkers and had the lunch special. For about $8.50 you get the chicken burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickle herbed aioli- more mayo textured, pimento cheese served on a delicious bun. This is served with fries, ""dessert"", and soda/Iced Tea. Great deal! 

 The  burger itself was pretty good although I'm not sure I would be back based on that alone. The fries were really good (fresh cut and herby) but when I asked for a side of ranch (don't judge) it was watery blue cheese- ick, and since I'm not a ketchup girl I wished there was a thinner aioli or something just for those...then they would be perfection! 

The dessert was a mean joke- basically they were like a Little Debbie-esque snack pecan pie with wrapping left on. I was really disappointed and wish they just made a fresh cookie or just left it out all together. 

This would have earned 3 stars but our service was terrible.

 Aloof describes our waiter perfectly well. Drinks were left unfilled, he couldn't bother to crack a smile, and he put our checks in the middle of the table (hey we all got the same thing you could have just passed it around to us politely). We had one to-go order which was the special and a salad - this took longer than all of the other meals, even though that was ordered at the same time- she was leaving early so that was definitely a problem...he also failed to mention that he added 20% gratuity- which at $1.70 a piece wasn't a big deal but it's always a bit sketch when they don't say it outright. It seemed like he knew he was getting gratuity added so he didn't bother to be friendly....so -1 star based on service alone.",3,UoAhCbIg2i9HokxbNFyHpg

A faire entre amis où en couple car ça vaut le détour.

"Went today for a late lunch with my daughter. She said it was good food. The food was fresh and hot. Presented nicely. I liked that they served chicken fried rice instead of pork fried rice. They were flexible with substitutions. The swapped out the pork egg roll for a spring roll. The portions were large and we ended up taking food home even though we got the combination platter. Typical of Chinese food, I felt like I couldn't walk after eating. I had reflux, which was unusual for me. Then 4 hours later, abdominal pains and frequent visits to the bathroom. Took some pepto bismol and am waiting for that to kick in. All in all, I wish we would have gone somewhere else. I have never gotten sick from eating Chinese food. This is a first. And a last.",3,jGmxYBd-A1fYfWrBvdp2Ww
"I've been back to the place a few times since my review and am happy to say that the place has improved tremendously. 

The changes made to the decoration had a huge impact. There's a new counter facing the street where you can grab a seat and watch the world go by. Changes were also made to the plates and coffee cups (which are now small and nice mugs). 

Overall, the place looks nicer and cleaner. While the sandwiches have remained mostly the same, there were some nice additions to the menu in the form of empanadas, soups to go, cupcakes... 

Keep up the changes and improvements coming.",4,maGeDqQuR4sKULh8Ubt_Gw

However, its the Jamaican patties that are worth going for.  Sure, you can do it at home the same way without much trouble, but its just the fun of heading to MacKay and wanting it from there.  Its worth trying out, and very cheap to do so.",4,VGmuFhsZKHTC5ReKAdSSCA

"Ok. So we visited this place after meeting up with friends. 

We started with the antipasto.  The portions were small especially since there was 5 of us.  Better for two people. The glaring issue was the lack of bread or something to eat with the food. 

Next I had the pizza and the daughter had the chicken parmigiana.  The pizza was tasty but the crust didn't taste like it preprocessed.  Think McCain pizza.  The toppings and cheese was tasty 

The chicken parm was Hoo hum.  What drove my daughter batty was the service.  Quick to follow up about the food - hot and tasty but refills or drinks or water felt like she was no where near by.  We had to ask for a pitcher to serve ourselves.  When my daughter and others were offered ground pepper or grated parmigian cheese the server would reach across my daughter.  Even when she cleared the appetisers plates.  Once was ok but 3-4 times became annoying. 

Was disappointed.  Too bad as the desserts looked worth giving it a try but we decided to leave instead.",3,sRn0AsNd4q0WymF1LKlK4Q
"What made me happy: price 37$ for all including 2 diet cokes. The taste of the mint chutney was delish. Nann was beautiful 

What made me sad: no salad dressing, mint chutney served in shitty little plastic takeout containers though we ate in. No red wine. 

On a Friday albeit early the place was empty. Seriously just the two of us in a 75 seater. Salad iceberg with basics no dressing. 

Paneer something or other was spicy with 6 paneer

Beef Khury 2 chunks but really super tender. But 2 chunks. 

Rice old oily and cumin seeds fell to the bottom. Paneer and Khury don't come with rice

Kababs middles were tender ends dry AF. Looked like dog shit. 

*had to drown everything in mint sauce to survive the meal. But I liked it that way.",3,L6ez6WoQ-0qQlK2IGxP15g
"My wife and I took our mother here for an early lunch. The waitress sat us right away. There was not many people there so that was expected. The atmosphere was nice. The place was very clean and the temp was nice and cool. The waiter came over about 10 min after we sat down to ask us what we wanted to drink. 5 minutes to long. We ordered 2 waters and a black tea. 15 minutes later the drinks came. Wow. I was in ahh on how long it took to get our drinks out. They also brought out chips and 2 sides of salsa. Those were ok at best. I ordered the number #23. Thats a 3 item combo. I chose 2 cheese enchiladas and 1 beef burrito. My food was excellent i enjoyed it. However it took 37 minutes to get to me. My wife also ordered a #23. She had 1beef buritto and 2 chicken tacos. The buritto she said was ok and the tacos were just plain and terrible. She stated she woud rather have ""Robertos"" next time. My mother ordered a shrimp dish and she stated it was good but she requested no avacados. When her meal arrived it had avacados everywhere. There was NO apology for the mistake. The waiter just walked off. We had to damn near beg to get a refill on our waters. The check came out in 2 minutes. They got that done fast. It wad $50.00 i feel as if i was robbed. The only thing they wanted was my money. Crappy service. I will go somewhere else next time. Thumbs down!",2,jp2gn-oW6OETM5TTvq5sEg

The way the bar area flows doesn't seem to work great and it is really dark and really loud.  The view does make up for a lot and I was pretty impressed witht he wait staff.

"We are new fans of Zaytoon! The right hand entrance is to the restaurant while the left is to the market. We browsed the spices and delicacies while waiting for our food to be ready.

The meat is flavorful and the portions are equivalent to what you pay for. My SO loves the koobideh while I prefer chicken. With the rice, I like to mix in the butter and onions, then sprinkle the sumac.

"Disappointed in this location. Had found the gem on Bermuda and silverado the other night and we LOVED it   However today, skimpy ion the toppings and forgot the things we asked for on the side, which we did not discover until we got home.   And the veggie burger dry.

Also part of the draw for this restaurant is the ability to mix and match and change toppings but when asked for a list of toppings I was told they did not have one.  Seriously?  How hard is it to create a topping list, laminate it and have it available for your customers??  And your menu is an electronic board. It cannot be added?

I won't be back to this location.",1,xtjpRrLR1xPsrRz4Iwvpfw
"Oh yeah! Been here a handful of times and it keeps making it back on the list of breakfast/brunch destinations. Just can't beat good ol tasty diner breakfast. Not your typical diner though, they do it right! Perfect for the Vegas morning recovery meal. 

I normally opt for the corned beef hash. They make it crispy which just takes the hash to the next level. 

Another favorite is the chicken fried steak. Juicy and crispy all at the same time. Wonderful!

This time I tried something new. The chicken fried chicken. Basically just like the chicken fried steak but with chicken. Wow! Same juicy result, different meat. Loved it. Of course anything greasy probably tastes good after a night of drinking, games, and whatever, but this place is now permanently etched in as the default for breakfast. Do it!",5,xfNmLU92KjLQBgo7WAyIpw
"Don't believe the hype like I did. I've since removed all of my positive feedback regarding this company because of how they treated me as a customer and how they treat their employees. 
I used them over 7 months on a 3 wk rotation. So this review is not based on 1 or 2 services. This is an observation over time. 
Sometimes they didn't show up on time (no big deal), no call no showed me twice and rarely sent 2 people (a very big deal). One housekeeper doing the work of 2, while you are paying for two is no good. In my opinion, the housekeeper is being overworked as Im sure the housekeeper is getting the same pay whether they have another set of hands or not. I did NOT like that. The work should be divided properly between 2 people. Like other companies. 
 
I hired another company (see my review) who ALWAYS send 2, they are cheaper, they clean the windows and blinds without charging ""extra"" and  have never ""no call no showed"" me. Both ladies are in and out in 1.5 hours TOPS with more completed.
Everytime Superb Maids no called no showed or couldn't send 2 people, I always got a bunch of excuses (Mostly using my square footage as an excuse to not consistently send 2) 
As a client it's no fun waiting 3- 4 hours at home on your day off to:
A) Have one maid show up to do the work of two which takes twice as long. (Basic things would get missed, like cleaning the floor around the toilet, top of the range and fridge, bathroom mirrors, etc.) I don't want to pay for a service, lose 4 hours of my day, so I can go over and clean missed things after she left. 
B) Wait at home for NO ONE to show up. (Also very frustrating).
The impression I got is, if you have a small house/condo, they arent really interested in your business and will skip you on your scheduled rotation for a bigger, more expensive, client.

"Worst hospital I've ever went to!! I had sprained my ankle really bad and decided to go in and have it checked out. I sat in the waiting room for about an hour, waited on a bed for another hr just to find out that I didn't break any thing. At that time I was put on a cash account because I didn't have insurance. The agreed upon price I was told I had 14 days to pay was a little over $400. So at that point I had to wait until I got my check at the end of the week. 5 days latter I got a bill for almost $3,000! I was never given the full 14 days to pay and when I tryed to talk to them about this issue all I got was runaround. Found a little to late that this is one of the worst rated hospitals in the vally.

"2/16/18 Overall disappointing, especially since first visit was outstanding. Think I ordered a gourmet mac and cheese that time. Service was ridiculously slow! Love bourbon menu. Must have 75 options. Many varieties of scotch, too. Caesar salad average at best. No anchovies. Impossible Burger (Plant proteins, fat from coconut oil, and heme which is an ingredient found in all living things, that gives meet its flavor. We get our plant-based heme from fermentation. The impossible burger contains no animal products). Amazing that it is plant based and tastes so much like a moist burger. Order with rye bread, which adds a lot of flavor to the sandwich. Good, not great, compared to actual burgers. Featured on Fox 8 news. Sweet potato tater tots good, not great. Margarita flatbread not bad, but a bit boring. Live music every Friday. Good blues band that plays quietly enough to talk.",3,xoHk3OQNIxNaOoR1vaPIxw
"Every step I took I was told I was doing something wrong.  
First was my beverage. While I mildly understand the policy, it's poorly marked.
Upon looking for my desired books and not findIng any i walked into the music and DVD section.  I was then confronted and told I was not allowed to be there without giving my library card.  I then go to give my ID to those at the checkout and was informed I needed to give it to a different desk.  
At that point I handed back the books I did grab and left.

While some who love this place may think I'm simply an idiot let me add this.  I have no problem with their policies. It's not my place to criticize them.  I do have a problem with how everyone treated me.  It's as if the act of having to speak made then bitter or angry.  
While i will go back as it's simply too close for me to go anywhere else, I felt somewhat obligated to write this review.

Mark your policies more clearly and don't treat your patrons like a nuisance - or was it because I was dressed like a construction worker albeit a very clean one.",2,V94L9TOtt_K9kBlcqofrmg
"My teenage daughter and I were here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch after a morning of browsing at Vaughan Mills.

I haven't been to the AMC Centrium since AMC folded their Canadian operations.  As such there were only us and three other groups in the restaurant for lunch on a Saturday.  This was common for all of the restaurants there.  The interior decor is great, with a lot of solid woodwork that makes you realize that a lot of work went into making this place.

We were seated promptly, and our waitress explained the daily specials to us.  I chose to have the guiness beef stew.  I almost always order beef stew at most Irish restaurants, but my Irish friends never serve beef stew at home.  I wonder why?

This stew actually had a little bit of a spicy pepper kick to it.  Nothing to set your taste buds on fire, but enough to make you take notice.

My vegetarian daughter managed to get one of the ""special"" pasta dishes without any of the meat as her meal, and the restaurant was kind enough to deduct a couple of dollars from the meal since they didn't have to give her meat.",4,xHFJglEtawB_RaEgQuWzvg

I came on  sunday for an early dinner 
It was more of a breakfast brunch in hicktown kinda vibe 
The food was good , not bad  at all 
Not amazing but not bad 
I got the caprese salad (a huge plate of cherry tomatoes , & like 3 small pieces of cheese) 
The mushroom app, which was actually 3 small deep fried mushrooms and then the rest was zucchini or something .. that was dry and tasteless. & i was expecting mushrooms mainly 

My carbonara was pretty good ! :)  calamari was good as well

& the service was good my server was very attentive,  i appreciate it !",3,SppLXLxMYBqsi3HY9RzjIw

"Went to see Arie Spears earlier in the year and was impressed with the improv @ Harrah's.  Club was swank with a nice calm ""old school"" vibe.  The openers were funny along with Arie rounding out a nice evening inside the club.  Overall, I was comfortable inside the club and the wateriness was prompt with the drinks.",4,e4glK1a-30878jHJzhrFlg
"Haven't written a review in over a month due to an overwhelming schedule, but I had to take time to note about Bac. The food was great, the service was even better.

I'm in Cleveland for work, been traveling non-stop lately and feeling especially miserable. Was looking for some Asian food when I stumbled across Bac, Asian Fusion, didn't expect much. I got there during happy hour ($5 starters so I got 3...), there was only 1 waitress so took a bit of time, but she was exceedingly nice. When you are alone in a strange city, a friendly smile really goes a long way, and nice service at a restaurant after a miserable long day makes such a difference.

The food was delicious, more fusion than Asian, but awesome nontheless. I got the coconut crepe, gyoza, and lemon grass crab cakes. Coconut crepe was my favorite, I ate it so fast I didn't even stop to snap a photo! Crispy on the the outside, tender and moist on the inside, stuffed with crunchy bean sprouts, shrimp and ground pork, good balance of savory with sweetness of the coconut flavor, the texture reminds of a Chinese breakfast dish called """". The lemon grass crab cake was lightly seasoned, just a hint of lemon grass, and comes with an amazing chili aioli sauce, I think I will take all my crab cakes with chili from now on. The gyoza was my lease favorite, nothing wrong with them, just that gyoza never tastes as good as my homemade ones, I don't know why I bother to order gyoza at restaurants.",4,NEzO2BN3RwRZu7MbvMD7Ew

Awesome soups!

"Best Indian food! We truly enjoyed our visit here this evening. Went here on a google search for Indian food in our area. We order the same things at all Indian restaurants because we know what we like but these entrees surpassed our expectations. We ordered the Saag Paneer, Chicken Korma, Lamb Tiki Masala, Mango Lassi, Garlic Nann, and Rice Pudding. The flavors were so rich, everything came out perfect temp, and the customer service made our experience. I don't have one bad thing to say, we loved it and will be back one day!",5,E02OBpQKhCCkCXWKjsNhCg
Love the presentation of the bowl unlike soho sushi.  Needs to have more choices and have better tasting rice.  Not a fan of their spicy tuna because of the cut of it.,3,49BGNJE_Vc2KopXLk3opeQ
"Very funky place. 
I'd been wanting to check it out for some time and took the opportunity last week.
Was surprised to find it fairly empty on a Sunday Funday afternoon. There were maybe 8 guests...it was a bit odd.
My girl and I took some time to explore, and finally made our way to the trailer to order some food.
Staff was very friendly. We had a tuna melt and a Chicago dog. Though the tuna was good, it was not what I expected in that it was in a hoagie roll and so was not a melt in the traditional sense. The bread was dry and crunchy. It'd have been nice to have this information beforehand. So, good but disappointing. The dog was good. We also had corn which was good.

Additionally we grabbed Bloody Mary's at a bar stand. Very full of stuff but the mix was especially bitter, or vinegary. I am not a fan. Another quirky disappointment that might best to be explained to newbies, which I proclaimed.

Also, valet parking for an empty parking lot? No thanks. 

I enjoyed some of the quirks, but would've preferred a more traditional tuna melt and bloody mary or would at least have liked to be told otherwise.

Meh.",3,YzP6L2aOkYeqy9Kb9SMVfg
"I had been here only once with my mom, the service was really bad and the drinks were bad we didn't get to order food because our server came around once every few hours. Although she was nice she was very inattentive and we ended up getting the check after one drink.",2,mLiKfiIQTggLK_tx4vACig

"This property management company is beyond unprofessional. They gave us less than a 45 minute window to get back to them to sign papers when we were approved for the lease on a home that we loved. They sent an email at 3:15PM stating ""if we do not hear back from you by 4 PM we are moving on to next applicant.""  Wow! My husband and I do Not have desk jobs; therefore, we do not check our email minute by minute.  
I would run if you see that this is the property manager of your house.",1,th1HHFCeYQQw4KjXxTU-3g
"I tried this place out after hearing about it from the tip jar stories. It ordered egg roll, shrimp tempura and tofu with brown rice and veggies. The apps were OK but nothing great. The tofu was acceptable. The rice was a little dry. The veggies were almost entirely cabbage. The pictures show large pieces of broccoli and other items. What I got was just soggy cabbage with some carrot shavings in it so I had tofu with dry rice and it wasn't very good. It probably would have been good if there was a decent variety of veggies in it.",2,DIYfCDoDxv_WGa13HvK90Q

"Brian is great! I already had experience with him once before with my wife's car tint and he did a fantastic job. Price was very reasonable and the service was quick and professional. This was about 10 months ago. 

Fast forward to last week, my wife and I decided to put a clear tint on my master bedroom French door windows that leads to our balcony. We wanted to do the Llumar Air 80 which we have on our front auto windshield. It is almost completely clear which should not affect our HOA as it is not reflective or dark in any way. Our main reason for wanting to do this  is for heat and UV rejection as those windows are facing west and a massive amount of heat comes into the room and whole house every afternoon til the evening hours. I remembered Brian did a standout job on our auto so I gave him a call. Surprisingly, he still remembered us and got us a quote very quickly with just the glass measurements. Made an appointment to get the job done and he was at my house bright and early the following Monday when I was available. 

You can tell Brian loves what he does by watching the way he works. He started by trimming off all the excess glue around the window panes (glue has been there since day one when the house was built and the builders just left it like that). After that he covers the floors with plastic and sprayed soap and water on the glass and cleaned it all immaculately and carefully. If the tint was to come out perfectly he had to prep it well which he did spend a good amount of time doing. Finally the tint was put on, trimmed and bubbles squeegeed out. All in all it took a good couple of hours to do just two large windows but the results are fantastic! Room temperature was cooler almost immediately and we can really feel the difference! I'm sure this will help with our air conditioning and cooling costs but most importantly is our comfort level and with the curtains back and the blinds up, it just looks so great! 

Thanks Brian for another wonderful job! I will definitely come back to you in the future for all our tinting needs!",5,sfs03gHY3aQXvJkA03ecQA
"I contacted Porter Roofing because they did repairs on my garage roof twice (8 months between repairs).  Randy, the person who did both repairs came out as scheduled and acknowledge the leakages.  He gave me a good impression that he would correct the problem.  I had another appointment and I advised Randy to contact my wife who was in the home when he was done.  Up on returning home my wife stated Randy did not contact her and he left our home about 10 minutes after I did?  Ironically, it rained the following day and the leakage had not been repaired!  That was on this past Friday and today, Monday, I contacted their office and their voice mail box was full and not accepting any messages.  I can't believe there has not been any communication. I should have read their reviews as you are doing now!  This company has communication problems and poor workmanship!  I would not recommend this company based upon my experience and it's amazing how other customers have been treated very similar!  Don't do it!",1,4BISFEuMO63yPq_4qymD3A
"This is the best ice cream shop in all of Vegas.  It is a little expensive but you get what you pay for.  The sundaes are awesome.  My favorite sundae is the hot fudge, made w/ dark chocolate.

"I would not go back to this location. I've gone to three other locations for many years and had plenty of good experiences, but this time it turned out all wrong. My hair looks like it does when I spend a quick 30 minutes blow drying out my curls myself. There was a miscommunication about what I wanted, I guess - I was asking for a ""classic blowout"" - and though the girl doing my hair was nice and tried to fix it, it was too late (my hair had dried in spots and the subsequent attempt to blow it out left it kinky, poofy, and frizzy). I wish she'd used their hair menu as I was just looking for the ""red carpet."" I didn't realize the full extent of how bad it looks in the back until I took a closer look after leaving the location, or I would have complained on the spot. I am totally bummed I wasted $60 on this.",1,JXYKk4sPj0YKVh9gvPH78w

The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is casual. The servers are fairly attentive and polite.

Excellent and authentic overall.",5,41wlGn1PLgxhET_U63KjDQ

I ordered the orecchiette with spicy sausage and rapini and it was simple yet delicious. The pasta was cooked al dente, the spicy sausage gave it a perfect kick, and the portion was a good size for lunch -- I wasn't overly stuffed but I felt full by the end of our meal. Even though the restaurant was busy, my dish came out quickly.

The service was friendly and quick. We were able to sit on the patio area so we could people watch. I'd definitely come back again the next time I'm in Vegas to try other dishes here.",5,JP9nuAGxBDVumI_v4FZ9qw

"I got a flyer for this place while grocery shopping last week.  I worked late last night and drove by and figured I would stop by for dinner.  

I did not have a lot of time to look at the menu.  I asked for the basics and the young lady ran me through it.  I got brown rice with veggies.  I sampled the chicken and beef.  I chose the beef.  I did not see any sides on the menu when I glanced over it.  I got my bowl and the lady explained the sauces.  I chose their basic one and it was good.  The only thing is that I must have put to much on.  I made it a little to salty.  It was good though.  Next time I will cut back on the sauce.  

Overall the food is excellent and it is close to my house.  I will be back and recommend this place to anyone.",4,IO7H-_GgsrOhGkGvQzG0pg
"Great place to take out-of-towners for the bull riding! I seriously miss the old Buffalo Chip building with it's dark wooden walls and back bar. The new building is beautiful and they are paying for it with increased food and drink prices! But if you are looking for a cool place to take the kids or your mother in law, this is it. On Wednesday's they have the qualifying for the rodeo. Friday night is the big show. The purse (winnings) must be some serious money because bull riders come from all over and up from Mexico. They have built more grandstand seating so you can sit all the way around the ring.

Satellite bars are conveniently placed so you can get another beverage without having to go inside every time.

It's one of the coolest places to people watch as well. You have your Creekers - the artists, Cowboys, and Indians (and their dogs), you have the folks from Scottsdale, Desert Mountain and those who make the trek up from Phoenix, all smooshed together and having a great time.

Food is ok. Smoked meat, grilled sausages, burgers. All a lot more expensive than it used to be. But a friendly staff.",4,6sQEWgI9jkqp1eIjJUS-CQ

I had the fried chicken on rice, fresh crispy and enough salt and sauce to appreciate the taste. My wife had the On Choy (Thai style), came sizzling on a hot plate, real fresh and cheap $6.95, in fact the food here is really affordable, not a date restaurant, great for families or casual meal. Would come again.",4,coxzVQl_vEIURtgvjpe9uw
"I ordered a make your own bowl with tofu and added crab meat on half brown rice and half salad. The serving is very big so make sure you bring your appetite! I ate it in 3 separate sittings because it was a LOT.

The service is friendly- they are happy to explain menu items and provide samples. Personally the tofu is a little too sweet for my liking. If you are going to get tofu then I would recommend offsetting the sweetness with a spicy sauce. 

Their menu has quite a variety but does not have chicken or zucchini noodles as I have seen som other Poke restaurants have. The prices are comparable to other Poke bowls in Toronto at about $12-15. 

The restaurant is quite small with a intimate dine in area. I'm guessing it's more popular for take out. 

I tried the ponzu sauce and truffle mayo for my bowl and it was very tasty",4,pJWtFse9-xOzI9bHAe8ihw

"Once in a while a store comes along that excels at appealing to double X chromosomes. It reaches and grabs women as they pass, enticing them to come in and check out the giftware. I have never failed at finding a nice gift for a lady if I shop at Land and Sea. 

They have jewelry, books and journals, decorations and houseware stuff, purses, bath stuff and little gifts that are just adorable. They also have some limited kid's stuff and travel accessories, and a pretty nice selection of cards. It's like a one stop girl-gift shop.

I love the books which are all pretty eclectic and funny. There are bad-girls guides, and sex manuals, and ""porn for women"" (hunks with their shirts off doing housework) as well as books on yoga and traveling. The white walls and bright lighting help you pin-point on just the right item. Some of my favourite purchases have included: a voodoo toothpick holder, some funny books and a really nice tea pot.

This is just the meal we needed after a long day at the Foxtail pool. We shared three dishes. One dish was a made to order fried rice (Hakka Fried Rice Pot) made tableside.

"Let's start with the positive; the service was friendly and efficient(hence 2 stars), but they had to wear hideous faux aloha matching shirts and shorts. The decor is so bad it's bad; a nightmare of plastic plants covering every available surface lit by dim but still remarkably gaudy neon. Imagine if Big lots sold a furniture line they called Gothic rainbow. Now imagine you're looking at it through purple shades and that's what the place looks like in daylight. They also have Tiffany style lamps with flamingos on them - someone should go to jail for that. Did I mention the ceiling is covered in black mirror tiles? 
The large portions are no compensation for the underwhelming quality of the ingredients. Sour 1980s Gas station coffee, flavourless vegetables, and the cheese in my omelet resembled a generic version of a Kraft cheese slice.",2,F6TijRlOEmEk7MMJ_fdm4g

"I don't know, this place didn't really do it for me. In general, I don't like the super fancy vibe in Montreal restaurants, because you can get really amazing and unique food at a chiller places. So, in Montreal, fancy does not equal better food. So then why would I pay extra $$ just for some dimmer lights and a more extensive wine menu?

"Let me first off say that the place was very clean and the staff super friendly. Now onto the food we ordered the chicken pita, cup of fruit, chicken with rice, two sauces and potato salad. We sat around maybe 15 minutes and our food came. The chicken pita was so big that you couldn't close it they left a maybe half an inch thick tomato on it and the chicken wasn't shredded it was so big that the only way you could eat this is with a fork. The pita was kind of Dough-ie If that makes sense. They had a white sauce on there that was really good, I just wish I could have picked it up and ate it like a pita. As far as the chicken and rice, the rice has no flavor kind of tasted like that stuff you cook in the microwave in a pouch. The chicken was good a little bit chewy. The potato salad was OK. They have this green sauce (I wish I knew the names of the sauces I'm sorry) but that was really good mixed in with the chicken and the rice it made the meal better. I know this place is more like fast food but I was just thinking the flavors and the freshness was going to be better. If you're looking for something quick and filling this is it. If you're looking for a mediterranean flavor maybe try somewhere else.",3,a43MkZwyjNwvuSkvfuG43A

Today I decided to get the combo:1/2 a sandwich plus a cup of clam chowder. You can make up your own sandwich or get one of the specialty sandwiches; and all sandwiches come with a crunchy pickle. For $2.25 you can can get double meat, but the sandwiches have plenty of meat on them. If you're looking for dessert, Oakmont Deli also sells gelato.",4,tGU4ISrZBlwkJniv8gGNcw

Just don't ask for the won ton chips if you're getting your food to go.  Unless you really want someone to tell you off.  Or if I'm there to watch.  It's pretty funny.",5,hLNkOFKfweo6LPA3_A4wWA
"I think I have a new favorite in the quick service Mexican food game, and that is one of my favorite contests ever.

I was all prepared to get a salad but then, then I saw the magical tortilla spinner. I couldn't resist. 

I created the business listing while I was in line, waiting for it to be my turn. Was I in line for a ride at Disneyland or to get tacos? Its decor sort of reminded me of Frontierland at D-land, but the food was definitely better quality and price than that place. 

The service was quick and to the point. The food was especially delicious, considering I fancy myself a connoisseur of quick service Mexican food. I don't think they do their meats/dairy as responsibly as Chipotle, but I could be wrong. I had never been to a Cafe Rio until yesterday, so it's all new and shiny to me.

I did like how they put ""Tips to Not Get Fat Off Our Food"" in the bottom corner of the menu. (My words, not theirs, but that's definitely what they're meaning to say.) In case you don't know, you can save food for later and not eat it in one setting. OMG GUYS, did you know that??? Did you know that you don't have to eat all the food at once? Cafe Rio definitely makes it easier, as they put lids out to make everything a to-go box if you want.

I will definitely be back to try out the different things on the menu, but a single taco with rice and beans was enough (and yes, I did take some of it home).",4,oPrSk4eM7oSWtssWBS4hHA
"I'm always up for trying anew brunch place, I really wanted to like this place, but...I just didn't. I came by here for Saturday brunch after a run with my honey. First, we felt out of place because this place is fancier than the name suggests: hostesses in very nice dresses, dj, bartender, etc. Then, we were shocked by the prices. Maybe there should be another way to rate prices for breakfast places, but paying $12-$15 a plate for breakfast is more than we expected for eggs benedict or a hash dish. Although the food was fairly good, it just wasn't as mind-blowingly good as I had heard it would be or as I would hope it would be for the price. Overall, I have to say that the service was great. The servers and hostesses were attentive and helpful. Everyone around me seemed to be enjoying their meals. This place just wasn't for me.",3,7mXwe9v1bRX_aE5sCidVgw
"We had to make a Costco run and the options were either..........

A. Deer Valley- Great, probably my favorite Costco in/near Phoenix, but a little bit far from Surprise.
B. Arrowhead- Closest one to us, but ALWAYS a clusterfuck!
C. Avondale- Close, but had never been, so it would be the first time at this one.

We went with Avondale and I was glad we did!

We got there pretty early after opening which was nice.  We got a parking spot right next to the entrance, and had free roam throughout the store before the crowds started to pile up.  If you have been to any Costco, you know the type of stuff they carry.  We picked up our usual supplies, and were in and out within about 30 minutes.  Greeter at the door was incredibly friendly, as well as the boxer/cashier.  I can't remember a time where I had a less stress free experience at Costco.  It could have been due to how early it was, but whatever, it was a great trip!  I think I will be using this one in the future when the family has to make a run. (Will still use the Deer Valley one if I need an item or two..its 2 minutes from work).

I love Costco and had a great time here today at the Avondale location!  I'll be back, for sure!",4,FQMRKgv2HKy7KHJVMA-VCw
"We'd been looking for a good sushi bar for a long time--real sushi (not just rolls), fresh and tasty sashimi, served by a chef that knows what he's doing and interacts with the customers.  You get all of that at Hokaido.

"Disappointed with our (1st) experience tonight. Came in to have a few drinks and maybe dinner. Wanted to sit at the bar, got the last two seats. The young man behind the bar was busy talking to a young woman, when finished he didn't welcome us, threw two menus down and walked away. He seemed very uninterested in waiting on us. I noticed everyone around us had nice full glasses of wine, ours were tiny. We got the hint, we left and don't plan on returning. I guess we didn't look like the regulars but were ready to spend a nice night and plenty of money.",1,IuI98CTwHBBk5IzpZ7y5kg
"Zinburger might be one of my favorite places.  If only my wallet loved it as much as I do.  The hamburgers and chicken sandwiches are huge and delicious.  The truffle fries are magical, especially with the dipping sauce.  I have only had milkshake, but it was creamy, thick, and chocolately.  I like the idea of being able to have wine or beer or a milkshake or all three with a burger.  I love the bar, which is massive and has both indoor and outdoor seating.  I also enjoy the giant pasture painted on the wall with the signature cows.  My gripe with Zinburger is, of course, it is pricey.  To get a milkshake, burger, and fries, you are looking at spending $25 and that's without tip.  Yikes.  Now if you come with a friend or date, you can split shakes and fries to make the price less sticker shock.  Zinburger is definitely one of the few restaurants that makes me wish I had a sugar daddy.",4,jjQEzBfUXO661YJxNPyDaQ

Ordered from here for the first time & I was VERY disappointed. The sweet & sour pork was undone and the egg roll and rice were very bland and had no flavor.

"If you're a female craps player, skip this place. I LOVE craps. I love a casino with a five dollar table (which on a Thursday night, this place had. Just letting you know, in case you wanna give it a second chance.) We had an AMAZING shooter. I def made money, but I saw the dealer do TWO shady things. 

1. When I gave him a dollar for a hard way bet, he kept it. It never went on the double 5's I asked for. Maybe he's sexist and didn't believe I knew how to play the game? (You know, cuz I'm a woman. So obvi I don't know how to play craps.) 

2. I had a come bet, which got moved to the six. When the six did get rolled (BEFORE the shooter rolled 7,) he paid out the DUDE BESIDE ME. YES, I know I should have said something in the moment, but that often gets you no where while gambling. So I just quietly took the money I DID win and left. The second that shooter rolled a seven, I left. And I will surely gamble somewhere less sexist next time. (It wasn't Grant! He was nice. I feel bad I didn't get the misogynist's name, but I need to warn other female craps players in the future.)",1,gtC2IUKxJSXABUzmfr3vDQ

"The lighting is way too bright and our waitress wasn't amazing.  The Cowboy Maki roll is delicious, i suggest pairing it with ponzu sauce.  The steak roll is not good at all.  I love that they have mochi too.",3,c-QjjH2hdESZbPst0W2fZQ
"My brother and I took my mom and grandmother here for Mother's Day. We made reservations for 8. I found out later that they closed at 9 but it's a good thing that we eat quick. The food made it easy for us to do it though. Our waiter spoke Cantonese so it was great because my mom and grandmother barely speak English. It was a fusion restaurant so a bit of the familiar mixed with unfamiliar made for a great experience.

It's quite a small restaurant with not a lot of seating. Some may feel it's cramped but it wasn't a big deal.

We pretty much ordered half the menu. I order all 3 steamed mantou sandwiches, pork jowl skewers, confit duck wings, tea smoked duck breast, torched mackerel, fried chicken and lamb ribs.

Out of the 3 sandwiches, I'd have to say that the brisket and pork belly were on par with one another and the chicken one was just alright. The former two were very flavorful. Each basket comes with two sandwiches.

I think I enjoyed the pork jowl skewers the most. Just the right amount of fat for the tenderness plus it was both sweet and spicy on top of that.

I thought the duck wings were okay. I'm used to trying the duck wings from the local grocery store and they didn't taste that much different. Not sure if I'd order it again or if I got good value.

When it came to the duck breast, it didn't seem that different from the smoked duck breast that you get from the store. It just might seem like a thing regarding duck at this point. This was the most expensive thing on the menu so I expected a bit more.

The torched mackerel was worth it. It was tangy as most mackerel are and we spent a lot of time eating it. They said it was boneless but I found a bone here and there so be careful.

I don't really remember how the lamb ribs were so... I'm just going to say forgettable. Might have to order it again to see if they actually were.

The fried chicken here was awesome. They gave us a lot and it was extremely crunchy. It was good by itself but even better with the hot sauce. The kimchi was a bit random but I like kimchi.

My brother and grandma enjoyed it but my mom loved it. She was so busy eating, she didn't even have time to talk. I think the bill came up to $150 for the 4 of us. So, it was a bit on the pricey side but I'd still come back after saving a little or maybe I just won't order too many expensive items.",4,CJ9PenyAD4ykM2Av5l6FYw

"Worst experience EVER.  My mom and myself brought my sister in because she was still feeling awful from what her primary had diagnosed as strep throat.  The antibiotics weren't helping and we thought it may be walking pneumonia.  As soon as we got in, the concierge who seemed to lack any type of enthusiasm at all got her in the system and my sister and I were directed to the next counter to get a bracelet.  Only about 10 minutes go by before she is taken back and poked and prodded.  The doctor didn't say hello to my mom or myself at all, although the nurses were friendly.  We tried to explain that she may have pneumonia but he quickly dismissed us.  My sister can be rather flustered in this type of situation so we tried to help explain, but since she is 18, they wanted nothing to do with what we had to say.  They did not to an X-ray which startled the nurse who came back with her results later, but more on that down the line.  

After her insurance was recorded into the system, we were hurried back out into the waiting room where a few more people had populated.  My family and I were making conversation when we noticed a couple other patients complaining about the wait, which they had been told would be a few minutes, that turned into an hour or more.  One woman white, one black *It's important to know this, trust me*.  The black woman, who we learned was named Jasmine, found she was being charged for a room that she was never in.  She asked the nurse politely to speak to someone, as well as what was taking so long.  This prompted the white woman to also ask about what had taken so long seeing as her son was ill enough and like anyone in an ER setting, they wanted to get the hell out of there.  The nurse was very rude to both of them and was getting smart, so the black woman (Jasmine) asked for her name and the nurse covered her badge, but Jasmine thinking quickly, already saw it, and immediately asked for a social worker.  The social worker came out and spoke with the white woman but not to Jasmine, completely ignoring her, and worst of all, as soon as Jasmine spoke up for her right to speak to someone, with zero attitude, they called security to stand nearby just in case.

While Jasmine waited, the security guard whom I had a bad feeling about, was talking major smack about Jasmine to another patient.  Completely unprofessional right off the bat.  The nurse who refused to give her name was offering blankets to people in the waiting room, all except Jasmine.  PURE RACISM!!!!!

Eventually, my sister was taken back and given her results which were mild to say the least.  The doctor had recommended that she stop her antibiotics, which is stupid.  I come from a medical background and never once has anyone thought it was a good idea to stop your AB's before they are finished.  As we turned to leave we saw Jasmine crying in a corner with what I assumed was another doctor.  Jasmine ran up to my mom and said that the staff had called the cops on her and planned to have her trespassed.  My mom stayed behind because Jasmine was scared.  My sister and I went to get food and of course, by now I'm infuriated.  Under my breath, and directed toward my sister, I said ""piece of shit security guards"", which caught the ear of one of them.  He shouted at me as I rounded the corner out of the door.  As I exited, he came up to me, now mind you we are outside of his jurisdiction at this point as I was obviously leaving and not looking for a fight.  He came 2 inches from my face, cursing at me and telling me that he will have me trespassed.  I continued to say ""yes sir"" just to get him out of my face.  He went on about how there were sick people in this building, one of them being my sister who he was scaring the shit out of at the moment.  I walked away and returned with food for my family.  My sister was so anxiety ridden she couldn't function until she got to see my mom.  She had the idea in her head that the security guard would hurt her after his little display with me.  As soon as I told my mom what had happened, she lost her shit and asked for his name.  Needless to say, they claimed not to know his name and refused to give it up but said that my mom could pick up the red security phone and ask the security department for his name.  When she did so, the phone was silent on the other end and they refused to give his name up also. 

 We left and will not be back.  A police report was filed by me and my sister due to the incident with the security guard.",1,1dPNo1Fgs7OsFpuhGVKqHA

"My first experience at another salon in Madison was bad news for my short haircut. I had choppy and chunky layers instead of feathering or texturing, meaning when the cut finally grew out, it looked heavy and helmet like. I went to Thorps after reading other yelp reviews and booked an appointment with Bria. 

I was super excited when I met her to see that she also had an adorable short cut and knew exactly what to do with my hair. The place had a wonderful vibe, super welcoming and comfortable. Bria was amazing. She shaped and texturized my cut into something really stylish and cute that framed my face perfectly. (And recommended some great restaurants for a new 30ish person in Madison!) 

I am definitely going back and cannot recommend it enough!",5,Odg6hI43wns_U5W6UOIROA

"I've been to Flo's numerous times over the years, but there seems to be a downward trend.  It looks like I'll be finding a new Asian Fusion spot...

The Man and I had a couple hours to kill and hungry bellies to feed, so we popped into Flo's for their (seemingly) amazing happy hour.  I ordered a froo-froo drink, which I'm pretty sure was half-price because it contained half the alcohol it normally does.  Tasty, but strong? Um, no.  We moved on to a bunch of appetizers: crab puffs, chicken satay, spring rolls, BBQ pork, and pot stickers.  The BBQ pork was yummy, but that is where our satisfaction ended.  All of the other items seemed no better than from-the-freezer snacks I can get at the grocery store.  Are they making any of these on site?  Maybe, but it sure didn't taste like it.  The crab puffs were the most disappointing.  So little crab, so much cream cheese.  They should definitely take a look at that ratio and either rename the dish or up the crab quantity.  Just a thought...

Now I'm off on a journey for a new go-to Asian spot!",3,17ZhH1ho9RpGSgbd0qm3sQ

"I've already left my thoughts on this location. And I will reiterate, just start calling this location, ""Walmart""...because it is very clear that the employees and management team cannot hold up to what Target's standards are supposed to be. 

I avoid this Target at all costs if need be, you can smell the bathrooms that are located in the front of the store all the way in the back of the store. It's dirty, it's unorganized. I've said enough.

I'm re-writing this review because of the experience I had yesterday evening with an associate, Carlo. 

Yesterday evening I brought my son (who is 18 months old) in for a quick errand. We stopped by the bargain section and I let him pick out a sippy cup.

At checkout, I was speaking to the cashier (Carlo) about a price check - which he already had an attitude with me. 

Before I continue let me just point out that I am pretty well mannered, I have my child under control and I'm a normal person, not doing anything to deserve this attitude. 

While speaking with Carlo, my son, WHO IS 18 MONTHS. Is trying to hand him the sippy cup to scan it, he's not screaming or crying or tempering, just reaching the cup towards him that doesn't even reach up half way to his chest. 

Mid-conversation, Carlo grabs my son's wrist and yanks the sippy cup out of his hand like he was holding a firework and did something wrong.

Admittedly, I have never had something like this happen with my son. Ever. So I didn't even react, I was just in shock. He didn't say anything, scoffed at me, didn't thank me at the end, say have a nice night, nothing.

I left the store embarrassed and in shock thinking I did something wrong as a parent. I considered calling management but thought I was overreacting. Took some time to really think of it and thought, in no way was it moral of this employee to put his hand on my son like that. Even if he was being a brat (which let me remind you, he wasn't). That's not your kid, that's not your job. YOU DON'T PUT YOUR HAND ON A CUSTOMER'S CHILD FORCEFULLY. 


I contacted the store after thinking and was unable to get a hold of a manager. Shocker. 

That was it for me, never coming to this Walmart again. And I hope I never see Carlo out of his place of employment.

I went in last year for a biopsy, and he explained everything he was going to do, and even drew pictures of how cells grow, and really put me at ease.

"My friend and I decided to sit at the bar and boy did we quickly regret it. After 10 minutes of staring like a deer in headlights I had to ask for a menu. Someone was kind enough to pour us water, but we had to get up and find some straws, coasters, and silverware. The bartender was working like the entire US Congress was eating at Burntwood. The restaurant wasn't even busy....there were 7 customers at the bar. We watched as he poured his drinks and what a waste of booze. I don't think bartenders make drinks that fast on New Years....slow down cowboy. It was so comforting to watch him never wash his hands. He also placed the clean rack of dished right in front of us. Very rude and inconsiderate ""bar tender"". 

Our food came quick and it was good. No one ever came to ask us how the food was which was disappointing because I needed more ketchup. The bar had 4 people working and not one of them showed any interest in receiving a good tip. The restaurant manager was behind the bar at one point and didn't bother to ask how our meal was. I didn't even know who our server was because there were so many servers behind the bar. Cheers to the happy hours specials, but I'll never go back.

"I don't know what it is about Northern Chinese dim sum places... either I'm just really easily impressed because I have this sort of food so infrequently (maybe I'm just over the whole Cantonese-style dim sum thing?), or it's just that good. I have been here a number of times and I have always enjoyed the food here. This time, we got xiao long bao/soup dumplings, an egg/onion pancake thing, rice roll thing, spicy tofu, regular dumplings, and a bun that you dip into condensed milk. For the most part I liked everything except I could have done without the spicy tofu. The bun with condensed milk was really good, but so simple, it's like something you can just make at home yourself. Whatever they put into their dumplings was seriously addictive like crack though, like I couldn't stop eating them and just thinking about them now is making me salivate. The restaurant is also pretty nicely decorated as well, high ceilings, fairly roomy, etc. Great place to go to if you're getting tired of the typical Cantonese/HK dim sum fare and want to try something new and delicious!",4,jY6EDYw8ayy8hLfceBZgRg

"I've been trying to find the best sushi here in Pittsburgh and have been underwhelmed with what I've found so far until now. 

When it comes to seafood, I am quite picky of the geographical location of where the consumption of seafood takes place. Especially, if I am not surrounded by some sort of body of water. I grew up by the beach. So naturally my mentality is, if it ain't fresh, I ain't eatin' it!

Pittsburgh is not near an ocean but it does have rivers (lots of them!). Anyhow, I didn't ask them where they got their fish from. However, by the look, smell, and taste of the sushi, I cant tell it is fresh. The quality of fish is SUPERB! 

Also I overheard the sushi chef tell the story of his life. He's from Japan, lived in New York and had a sushi restaurant, moved to Pittsburgh, owned a Japanese grocery store in Shadyside, then opened up Kiku. While watching him make sushi, I noticed him using gloves AND washing his hands!!! I mean I've never seen that before but my inner-nurse was jumping for joy! 

I love that this place is authentic and quaint! There's none of that ""goop"" slathered on rolls, there's nothing wrong with that. But if you are looking for something more traditional. Kiku is definitely a hidden treasure.

What I loved: 
1. Miso soup - one word can describe it. UMAMI!!
2. Kagoshima - because I love yellowtail
3. Temaki Spicy tuna 
4. Nigiri Toro
5. TOMAGO!!! - slightly sweet and well made. One of the Best!

"Delicious, reasonably-priced Mexican food. Customer service was outstanding. We arrived about 15 mins. before closing, but they treated us like we were the first customers of the day.

"This is a family friendly casino in that there is a bowling alley and a movie theater for the kids, which most casinos do not have.  We just went to Circus Circus and it was packed with families with little kids... the kids loved it but it was just too old and dingy... that's why South Point was more enjoyable.
Plus there is Bingo with electronic devices that assist you play for just $10 with a players card.  I was able to play for an hour and only lose that much... close but no cigar.  My daughter won $200 last night... 
Don't forget Steak n Shake for an inexpensive meal too.
Not bad after spending $200 at the Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmopolitan (well worth it by the way)... 
anyways... two people won over $500 and another won $700 tonight... lot's of fun.
I'm going back tomorrow to try my luck... wish me luck.",4,tZEKv4073AS27_hI6CS78g
"We have lived in Vegas for about three months and we have gone to Oh Jah twice! Both experiences were great! The hibachi chefs are hilarious and know how to put on a great show.  They were also aware that we had our 7 month with us and made a small flame for him before making a bigger one, so the fire didnt scare him. I tried a roll each time and was not disappointed. I definitely recommend this place if looking for a fun moderately priced meal.",5,50h-mmQ-4GTQvZW3naYfDA
This is the BEST hair salon!  My hair stylist was Reiko and she was incredible!  She listened to what I wanted and gave me great recommendations.  I love her and I love my hair!  She is so friendly and personable.  I highly recommend this salon.  All of the employees in the salon seemed very professional and the salon was very clean.  All of the customers that left the salon seemed extremely happy.  I am so happy with my hair and I have been receiving so many compliments.  Thank you Reiko!!!,5,tVzgzguKFn2wbyCUrTLxOQ
"I have a new favorite coffee place. I decided to come way out of my way to try this place because I kept seeing their vegan pastries on FB. They did not disappoint! The vegan breakfast pocket is hearty and filling. The cheese tastes ""real"". I'm a black coffee drinker, got the Sumatra and it's excellent. I love the decor and atmosphere too, local art on the walls and decent music playing. Anytime I'm on this side of town I'll be here!",5,s1-0VVyYe5Sgxo2cdbGZzw

"DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!  Be aware they prey on your frustrations and definitely do not set the real expectation up front.

Robert, the technician, who also goes by the name Bobby will tell you everything is going to be great when installing a new water heater.  Then when he finally arrives, he will tell you that the home warranty company does not cover modifications.  These modifications cost $40 tops, AM/PM plumbing wants $224 for the modifications.  Robert will record your conversations without letting you know, because, well these surprise expenses tend to get people excited including Robert. Robert refused to give me an invoice and threatened to take the water heater out, put a lien on the house, take us to small claims court and call the cops because he felt threatened.",1,WLmDKm2nM1UXo10f0y4zpw
"Uhhhh, not a mile long... not even close. However even though it's not a mile long, it's really easy to get LOST in the funky shaped U thing they have going on... it took a map, 3 gals and 15 minutes to find H&M in this place.

Regular ole mall...kinda like any which one you'd have at home. But it worked to kill some time walking around on a slow evening after dinner. Of course I managed to find something to buy, I always do!!",4,dDVsrPD9nC8K-nF0VnM8Xg

This place is absolute garbage.  Slower than a sloth covered in molasses.  Waited 20 minutes for 2 burgers and a small fry and someone who order three orders after me got their 2 chicken  sandwiches and fries before me.  Sounds about right for this spot. -2 stars,1,x1bI8h32Z7IUUTXcwF84Ng

Pretty cool spot. Cool to place to come get drinks. Had the oxtail and veggies. Was a little lacking in flavor. Maybe a pinch of seasoning for the veggies. Sea salt even. Tomato rice was not bad. The beef shanken salad was pretty solid. Liked it. Would get it again. Good soy vinaigrette and good sauce on the beef. I'll try it again. Hopefully gets better.,4,_t904Y4_caG6kWciICkRyA
"Debated a long time yesterday how many stars to give Blackstone, but after today's discussion with my family where we again complained about the faults of yesterday's dinner, I decided that two stars was the right rating. This was due to two reasons: the poor cuts of beef and the bad managerial decision.

Steak:
We ordered one of each steak cut: the tenderloin, sirloin, and the rib eye. The 8oz tenderloin was well executed and the highlight of the night. The cut was tender and juicy. However, it went downhill from there. The sirloin and the rib eye were far too tough and chewy. There were literal pieces of tendon dispersed throughout the cut, which made chewing very difficult. It wasn't particularly flavourful either. The steaks were impressive merely due to the lava stones upon which they were served; they were otherwise a disappointment. 
My dad also ordered the lamb shank, a pitiful piece of mush that came drowning in an overly sickening sweet BBQ sauce. There was absolutely no flavour whatsoever; it was an overdone, overbraised lamb. That said, I suppose we were at fault for ordering something other than steak at a steakhouse.

Service:
We came to celebrate my sister's birthday; I had called in advance to let then know and asked whether there would be any dessert or celebration. The manager had mentioned that they could bring a cake with a birthday song and decorate it nicely - just to let him know upon arrival. I did just that, but decided to confirm whether the celebration would be on the house. He said that it wouldn't be, which is totally fine, so I told him that I'd reconsider and let him know later. Halfway during the meal, he walks by with a pat on my shoulder, assuring me that he ""will take care of it"". From that, I assumed that he decided to provide the cake on the house, and was delighted. You can imagine my shock when I see the $8 charge on the bill at the end! While the celebration was a nice gesture, I never explicitly asked for it. That was because I didn't feel that a measly small piece of cake was worth $8, no matter how good. For him to make a decision on my behalf - the customer's behalf - is simply unacceptable.
The servers, though friendly, had difficulties understanding our order. The sides for the steak were switched, so we had to go through the trouble of righting their mistakes. Moreover, they just kept checking in on us, which almost felt as if they were breathing down our necks a bit. It was slightly pushy and overwhelming. 
Finally, the table space was very tight. There was simply insufficient room for all the plates and stones. However, despite our raising of this point, they simply dismissed it. The cramped table simple made dining there uncomfortable.

Conclusion:
If you're craving a good steak, I would not choose this place. If you're interested in the experience of the lava stone, then sure, come and try. I won't come again only because I feel that we were ripped off with the sudden charge and delivery of the birthday cake.",2,gwydKSx5L9a1ZUIGtXZebw
"Give this place a try, the food is good! We ordered a gyro plate, hummus w/pita, and a gyro (Aphrodite) and a side of potatoes. Everything was well above average, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. I highly recommend the Little Greek :)",5,5vbqO06Y6pBIhbGLj5ZUmw

My friend took me to Chompie's on my first visit to Arizona. We split the Jewish slider challenge with two of her children and brought the leftovers home for the rest of her family! We also had Lovey's smoked salmon tapas as an appetizer. OMG.  This was definitely my favorite meal of my trip!,5,txsnLkIjG6IA68OZpDiKpw
"I recently stayed here, not even a week ago, and it was less than okay, and I'll explain why...

1) This hotel is not located on the strip, initially I knew that, but my boyfriend was dying to stay here so I compromised, knowing that there'd be a shuttle plus he said we'd just take cabs seeing as though it was only a mile from the strip. Come to find out the shuttle ran every half hour which is horrible, & only sat 12 ppl so if you were the 13th you would have to wait until the next one came which was a whole half an hour later AND it stopped running at 8 so if you wanted to leave your hotel after 8 or come back from the strip to your hotel after 8 that's a 12 dollar cab with cash, 15 with a card (for a mile long ride!). You can see how hanging out after 8 outside of your hotel can add up in cab fees if there's only 2 of you like it was for me.

2) When checking in there were only two receptionists and they moved pretty damn slow. We checked in, I want to say around 11pm, which is probably why there were only two staff but it's a hotel, it's Vegas, people are checking in all the time, so the wait for that was a little ridiculous.

3) The wifi was Blahhh, it was very slow and I had to enter my name and room number constantly to keep connecting back to it... Annoying!

4) The food wasn't cheap at all, it was 45 bucks for my boyfriend and I to eat at the buffet which I thought would have been fitting for two ppl that didn't stay in the hotel opposed to two ppl that did BUT I will say that they served endless champagne which diffused the situation for me, they did good with that (finally!)

5) There was a $20 fee a night so when I was checking out that was $80 for me but they attempted to charge us for a Gatorade and some other item that we never used which hiked up the price. After we told them we hadn't used anything in the mini bar they did take those items off of the bill. Twenty dollars a night is still kind of ridiculous after paying hundreds of dollars for the hotel room already, don't you think?

6) At this point I'm done talking about this place! There are already too many deterring points I've made about this hotel that I just do not feel like continuing. On the ups the room was nice and newly renovated and we had two beds when we only needed one, the bathroom was really nice and the tv had cable so good job on that I guess. We were able to do one party at the ""Moon something"" for free after putting ourselves on the guest list. The party itself was a little corny but the rooftop view was pretty cool.

7) All in all if you MUST stay here it won't be your worst experience, especially if you're richer than me, lol, but I would recommend staying somewhere on the strip, it's much more convenient, some of the hotels are less expensive, and you won't have to worry about carfare after 8pm! I, however, would NEVER stay here again!",2,ebtOQUVX4kkzAKjY1_k_bA
"Great atmosphere, but not the hugest fan of the Mac N' Cheese Bowl. The Mac N' Cheese tasted quite average, as in there was nothing special about it. It's great that the dish is served in a container so that a lid can easily be put on it to bring home. On top of that, the dish was served in a large portion and is extremely filling. 

Staff was super friendly and constantly refilled our water and checked up on us. Also, getting to the washroom was a bit confusing, but one of the staff kindly guided me. I heard amazing reviews about this place and will most likely give it another try!",4,wQdJkpMKieacYRe9bWgWLA
"This place is nothing more than a dream come true for fans of well cooked meats and foie gras!  Despite the small walk-through space and single bathroom, you can't go wrong with the tinted lighting, wood and brick walls, and open kitchen concept, making for a very welcoming dining atmosphere.

The food is slightly on the pricey side, with an average dish ranging from $25-37 depending on what you order. But the portions are well worth every dollar. One dish is enough to satisfy a big eater; two dishes will induce food coma. And when you're dealing with meats slow cooked to perfection, marinated with simple yet delicious flavours, and well complimenting sides, it can get very easy to get carried away with wanting to try everything.

I sat down with five other friends, all of us guys and in Montreal for a bachelor party (attention bachelor party planners, this is the perfect place for dinner). They sat us near the open window, which for a warm evening was great. It gave us room to breathe and a good view of the restaurant or of the street depending on where we looked.

After a round of beers, we shared a Boudin Tart and a Duck Carpaccio. The tart crust was light and crispy topped with caramel onion, potato, and blood sausage cooked to perfection. The foie gras drizzle on top made for a light but wonderfully complex marriage of flavours and the dish was shared evenly among us. The Duck Carpaccio went as quickly as it appeared. The thinly sliced pieces of raw duck signified meat of the highest quality and flavour, and it was balanced out with an egg yolk, olive oil, mushrooms, capers, and mushrooms.

The main dishes were equally spectacular. The PDC cut was a roast so big, it had to share it. It was cooked very well. A crispy flavourful exterior with a well done first layer down to a juicy medium rare interior. The veal rib was a massive, single rib with melt off the bone, tender, and astoundingly seasoned meat. My duck magret in mushroom sauce was absolutely spectacular. The sauce was a light white wine flavouring, thinly sliced mushrooms covering thin slices of duck cooked medium rare. With each slice, the flavour of the duck became more noticeable.

Dessert was light, since by this point we were all stuffed. I ordered a maple toffee milkshake. It wasn't big; served in the same glass as our beer. It was a frothy shake, not thick, but it also had a light, non-invasive sweetness. The toffee flavour came from a thick piece of toffee that sat in the shake and could be eaten at any time. It was a satisfying end to a satisfying meal.

The star lost was mainly due to the poor service we got from the main waitress. The bus boy was fantastic. He promptly refilled our water and got us more bread than we could stomach. The runner was equally pleasant. But the main waitress had a bit of attitude from her greeting, was not helpful in any way, and never came back to check on us. If it weren't for her assisted helpers, we would have had no interaction with any staff. Also, we were warned that the PDC cut would take 50 minutes to prepare, but after an hour of waiting, no one came with an update. I can see how this would have turned off tourists from recommending the place, or from wrecking the dining experience.

However, Au Pied de Cochon has quickly become a go to place whenever I'm in Montreal. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and when you talk about value, I wouldn't have been angry if the prices were even higher than they are considering the quality. I highly recommend this place!",4,3Ul4BrRVGarGsf0tWXkMFA

"I was a bit disappointed, as I had been excited to try this place out for a while. We were seated in a corner booth and the walls around us were visibly dirty. The server, though friendly and attentive, was pretty clueless.  I told her that our daughter had a peanut allergy and if I could see the food allergy menu.  She had no idea what I was talking about.  When we asked if there were any items that have peanuts in them or were cooked with peanut sauce or peanut oil, she said the hummus.  While it sounded strange, we didn't say anything at the moment.  Later when she brought our food, I asked if the hummus was really made with peanuts or maybe she meant chickpeas?   She said she had to ask the kitchen and get back to us.  Overall, our food was okay, but nothing great.  As food allergies are becoming more common and some are potentially life threatening, such as a severe peanut allergy, I think it's important that the staff is more knowledgeable and better prepared to handle questions about their menu.",2,p_7h_w7N6lu24hxRgLGUiw

"I called to make an appointment for a haircut and little did I know I was making an appointment for a total pampering! It all started with a neck and shoulder rub with an oil of my choice.

He warned me that I may see a lot of hair being cut because we decided on framing my face and layers but he would keep it long. He did an amazing job bringing my straight, boring hair back to life!

"This is by far one of my most favorite, if not favorite, hotel I have had the pleasure to stay at. I stayed at the Vdara in October of 2012, and it took me by surprise. They have great deals and offers and got a really good deal with one night for free which extended my vacation. Upon arriving at the Vdara, the experience was remarkable. As soon as you walk into the lobby, you automatically get this great feel of classiness and cleanliness all over. A very slick and sexy hotel no doubt, great for everyone. Even though the Vdara has no casino, its actually a great benefit. Nice and quiet, great for relaxing and if you're ready to gamble, the Cosmopolitan and the Aria are literally feet away. Another benefit of the Vdara is that you have the tram station at your hotel which leads you to the Aria and Monte Carlo, very very convenient and nice ride too, you get a great view of the City Center that you cant get without getting on the tram. The rooms are amazing, very modern and classy as well. I also had a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the Cosmo, nothing better than waking up watching the show. The curtains as well are automatic, which is very cool as well. The bathroom is unbelievable and overall this place surpassed my expectations. I 100% recommend staying here, don't pass it up!",5,YIvFbkqWhhrRgQscV8LJBQ

theres breakfast, lunch, dinner served & i've never been, but then around 8pm ish they start changing the setting to the night bar atmosphere.

The sushi and prepared food items are really fresh and made with care, large salad bar and made-to-order stir-fry station are great additions to a great store. The product selection is vast for a medium-size grocery store and the people in the deli, fish and meat departments are super friendly and helpful. I've always had a good experience with Heinen's and I would recommend anyone in the area to stop in a check out their bakery and meat department.

For those of you unfamiliar with the word, truie means sow in French so the name refers to a fat female pig.  The menu is true to its name so there are plenty of pork-inspired dishes here.

The restaurant looks very simple and unassuming from the outside.  Once inside though it feels elegant and intimate.  It is also quite large inside so there is plenty of seating to be had.  They also have a terrasse that looks like it would be a nice place to sit in warmer months.

While there are some non-pork based dishes like beef tartare and duck I thought it best to see if the restaurant does a good job with pork products.  That meant that I ordered the tomahawk, which was a pork chop garnished with apple sauce and served with a sweet potato puree.  I enjoyed the flavours of the dish but I felt that the meat was a little overdone as it was on the tough and chewy side.  The portion was pretty big so I'm glad I skipped the appetizer since that would have been overkill.  I also tried a mouthful of my friend's ribs which were really tender.

Dessert was a brownie served with caramel bacon ice cream.  The ice cream was really good and I liked how the salty and sweet balanced each other out.  The tiny chunks of bacon also added a nice touch.  The brownie on the other hand was rock hard and impossible to eat with the spoon they gave me.  It was really dense and chocolatey so that was what seemed to give it that hard texture but I would have traded some of that for something that was softer and easier to eat.

The service was great.  Our server seemed to know the menu inside and out and he did a great job with recommendations.  Everything arrived in a timely fashion and he did check on us regularly to see how we were doing.

Prices were okay but I felt that since my dishes weren't the greatest they could have been better.  I think the restaurant definitely has potential but it does need to work on its execution a bit.  The experience as a whole was just okay.  Nothing awful but nothing excellent either.",3,fBuIXRXM3EAG04-ZV3Lr_w
"Found this place on Yelp and it was amazingly delicious. I had the unagi special burrito with seaweed paper. The staff was very friendly and helpful, allowing me to try a couple sauces before deciding which ones to use on my burrito. My only complaint was that there were large inedible bones in the unagi. I'm used to soft, edible bones when I order unagi, but these ones could really hurt someone's throat.",4,bTImjDy4ch4O3DRpyzS5bQ

I can appreciate that the food was fresh, but for an hour lunch break, I feel like I waited 30 minutes for my food.

they're very busy, so make sure you go really early if you're going to risk it.

"The menu was great, had tons of variety, it was actually hard to make decisions!

The food was tasty, my only suggestion is every dish came out warm, not hot, even the plates themselves were cold to the touch.

What made this experience amazing was the service, Steven is probably one of the best servers I've experienced in a really long time. He has very knowledgeable about the beverage and food menu, offering great advice. He was attentive yet discreet and very friendly. Sadly, this type is service is not the norm anymore. 

Fabulous overall!",5,RhHkLqOEAxokU0ubGdXDAA
"LOVE! I've had shellac done before and it was awful, but I tried this place on a whim and I will be returning regularly on a monthly basis now. The lady I had (Lily?) was so focused and made my nails look perfect before applying the shellac. The whole manicure took close to an hour as she was such a perfectionist and my shellac lasted 3 WHOLE WEEKS. I never thought that would even be possible, but it didn't chip, nothing. My mom also got her nails done at the same time and they lasted even longer than mine. We took the shellac off at home to save money and both of our nails were so long and healthy. 

So impressed. And this place is probably one of the cheapest in halton, at $30 for a shellac manicure it'll be hard to beat. Can't wait to go back.",5,VwbHxeveoc_rc-fUxyTekQ
"Hubby and I enjoyed our daytime at Paris. We upgraded to a room with a view of the strip, opened the window, and there was the Eiffel Tower. Pow! The pool is lovely, although a bit chilly this time of year. The street walk (inside) really does remind me of Paris, although the prices are too high. I was looking for quality croissants or French rolls, and didn't find them, sadly. 

With the upgrade we got continental breakfast and drinks and ""appetizers"" at night. We felt that was a great bargain because the night food became our dinner. And two drinks apiece per night was plenty. The breakfast was plenty, too, with yogurt, fruit and cheese, bagels and lox, and so on. Much more than ""continental"" suggests.

The worst thing about the Paris is the Frankie Valli music in the elevators--yuck! After listening to that ad nauseum, I would never see ""Jersey Boys.""

The second worst is the loud, pounding music that hit our room until 4:30 am (!), and we were on the 21st floor (!!!). My husband called to complain, and he was told the hotel's president made the decision to allow the loud booming until 4:30. For that reason, we could not stay here again. While I sleep like a rock, my husband couldn't sleep.",3,Uczlhvw9cPT_pj7ARVHOTA

"I am going to have to give social house 3.5 stars and here's why. When we arrived we waited outside at the valet service for 5 minutes and no one showed up to take our car. We didn't want to wait any longer so luckily we found another spot on the street. The interior of this place is breath taking and I really did appreciate the level of detail that went into building this place. The food was excellent nonetheless; however, portions are very small. I can't attest to all of their dishes being this way, but what my mother and I ordered was small. I left the restaurant still hungry. The flavor of my dish was incredible though and I could have ate more of it no doubt! My dish was the short rib yaki noodles ($16)! My mom ordered the scallop pad thai ($19) which she also really enjoyed but also agreed more noodles would have been nice. I would like to come back for a late dinner and drinks. Maybe try out their sushi options or even the ramen.",3,4gQeL3VVgf5rjxGP3u4QwA

"You can go on the strip and pay $50+ for your average dinner and $100 for a gourmet dinner; without booze. You can go to Buca or Olive Garden for generic Italian food.-YUCK (the people who think Buca or Olive Garden are true Italian restaurants are the type of people who think Italian is pronounced with a Long i. lol Or you can stop at Battista's which is old world kitschy-old school; dark and woodsy with huge collections of salt and pepper shakers ...the menu is on the wall...prices range from $20-35. Each meal includes soup or salad, garlic bread, carafes of Chablis or Cabernet and your entree and then capp after your meal. I ordered the boring spaghetti and meatballs....loved loved loved the dish.  I rarely finish a meal as pasta seems to fill you up so fast but I hated to leave the pasta bowl. It was a wonderful sauce seasoned just right with huge meatballs-home made. Service was just fine and the accordian was a nice touch.",4,bPMGmdXDWEIjuFnxdTm-0A
"I loved this restaurant. I am a sucker for hipster decor especially the light and airy vintage type this one is. The atmosphere is very chill and relaxing. It would be a perfect place to meet with friends for some drinks or for a business meeting. You can either sit inside in one of the different rooms they have or you can sit outside with a view of the pool. 

All the employees I interacted with were very pleasant and respectful. I had the turkey club and my boyfriend had the Madame Croque. Both were absolutely amazing. I added a friend egg to my sandwich which made it even better in my opinion. 

Even the fries were really good. The turkey was fresh and the dijonaisse really added a good flavor. Everything is seasoned generously but I like seasoning but I can see how someone can think it's too much. 

The madame croque was out of this world. It's brioche bread with ham and gruyere cheese, a Parmesan crust on the brioche and an over easy egg on top. So simple but so good. It comes with a small side of brown mustard I believe and a couple mini pickles. I highly recommend this dish. 

All in all great atmosphere, great service, great food. I will definitely be back when I am in Vegas again.",5,bKxbyyekb5pJQZcLjMQlgQ
"I was really excited to go here because the area is really nice and their website lists the places they accept clothing from and it listed all the stores where I shop. I ended up being super disappointed in their selection and they have not updated their site in awhile apparently. Style Encore was honestly more beat up than Plato's Closet. They accepted a ton of faded and cheap fashion from places like Forever 21 and other no name brands and their assortment was awful as a result. This store is geared toward teens who dress casual and wear leggings and athletic tops. I never saw so many pairs of faded overpriced leggings and dirty boots. I was expecting high end dresses, blouses, and pants from WHBM, Arden B, Express, Ann Taylor, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, etc. But it was all junk and I feel bad for the owner because it looks like Goodwill in there. I do not see them staying in business much longer and hope they update their website so others do not waste their time like I did. The employees were nice is the only positive thing I have to say.",2,yJ-2bWLiBvanth3NHdaSnA

"I had lunch at the Scottsdale location this week.  I was carrying a Contigo water bottle.  The hostess who seated me asked what was in the water bottle.  DUH - water!  Odd- never had that happen before.   I was seated right away but it took 10-15 minutes for the person to take the order.  Food came out very quickly.  Chicken breast was lukewarm, tough and not very tasty.  KFC has better chicken for less money.  Waffle was ok but the maple syrup had no maple flavor.  Paid with a credit card and had to show a driver's license.  Odd again -- can't recall that happening in a long time.   There are many places to eat where the food is better and your water bottle is not treated with suspicion.  Skip this place",1,X3_Pd6L7ZTjn65XaQPq_hg

"This was first experience using a tanning salon, so my review is completely based on my only experience which is at this location.

My four star review goes to:
-Customer service, 9/10 times there are very friendly employees and many of them recognize my husband and I when we walk in--always a nice thing. Austin is great :)
-My husband and I pay as much as our gym membership, which is a plus! Good prices and there are often specials or upgrades that come free or at a low price.
-Tanning beds are clean and the front lobby is appealing, HOWEVER, I generally use one room when I go in and the same dust bunny/hair...something...has been there since we started about 6 weeks ago. The bed itself is clean, but I actually bring in my own towel to stand on so I don't put by feet or clothing on the floor.

Other than that, a great initial experience and a continued customer.",4,lp_CP9WZSkhGNb19ndpgpQ
"This sandwich and rugulach habit is getting ridiculous. The BF and I have come back several times in such a short span. 

The first few times we got breakfast and I highly recommend for eggs benedict fans to get it here. I love hollandaise and they are not skimpy with it, ham actually has flavor, perfect poach eggs. I tried the crab cake version too, and surprised I liked the original better. The corned beef hash was another we tried and I thought it was tasty. I love their potatoes the brekkies come with and the bagels of their name sake actually are quite nice. 

Then I decided to try their corned beef sandwich and was prepared to be only mildly satisfied. I have a little Jewish corner of my heart that beats for childhood Saturdays at Langer's. The corned beef was flavorful, juicy and the marbled bread I chose was great. I always eat mine with  coleslaw and Russian dressing (aka thousand island). I'm normally into pickles, but theirs is closer to cucumber than pickle so I'm not the most fond of it. The sandwich was so good, I was a bit sad to  share with the BF and take the other half of the benedict even though I love the bennie. 

So we came back several more times to get our own. I have to say that the way to go is the soup and half sandwich deal ($10.95- $11.95). It actually comes out cheaper with more food since the sandwich was just as big as a 1/4th lb, you get soup and can even get a side if you wish for $1. The matzo ball soup here is decent, and the sweet and sour stuffed cabbage was nice though I dropped my phone in it trying to Yelp it. We also tried the lobster salad sandwich and that was solid, but I'm gonna stay with the meat sandwiches..... I should mention I lean towards mostly eating vegetarian and this place is testing it. 

Service is pretty decent on checking up. We also don't go during busy times as this is the type of place that gets swamped during regular breakfast/lunch hours on weekends. Beat the busy by heading in a bit later in the afternoon. 

While the sandwich and benedict have been stellar, the dessert counter has been extreme highs and lows so much so that I can't justify a 5star. 

The best: The rugulach are awesomely good. I normally don't like chocolate ones but I love them here, the almond ones are great, all the fruit ones are great. There is not a bad one so even though it is priced per pound, I feel this is worth it. 
The subpar: I'm not fond of the black and white cookie being more like cake. I know a lot of delis do this and I'm just more of a shadortbred person.  The rainbow cookies were okay, but not quite up to my standard with it being too wet though the sponge flavor was right on (those are one of my favorite deli sweets). The homemade twinkie was a bit dry.
 The bad: we got a slice of buttercream cake which was painfully sweet with the frosting tasting like boxed. It was thick, sticky and you can feel sugar granules in it with the cake itself also rather sweet. It was a throwaway so I will not be getting anything else but rugulachs. The desserts aren't cheap for what they are...Spent $27 with only the rugulachs being the only thing we are gonna eat the entirety of. 

This is great place and I do highly recommend this as a go-to if you're in the area, just know how to navigate the deli and massive menu through recommendations.",4,2FHrNZ0c95bIXoUqVq1YAg

My project was not done by Marcel. But by a third party. First, I had to tell the Forman several times that there were holes that were not patched. They patched MOST of them, but left a big one right in the front of the house near the roof. They also were in such a big hurry to finish that they left three screens FROM THE SECOND FLOOR leaning against the house. Just this morning I was looking at the house and noticed spots that had not been painted at all.

"After finding Crossfit North Valley on another website, I decided to give it a shot (June of 2014). I was able to schedule my first workout according to my schedule and had one-on-one training on my first visit. On my first day, there was several members who immediately adopted me into their ""gym family"" and encouraged me with my lifts and running. I have now been a part of this gym for 10 months and it is the one thing that I have been able to stick to the longest and it is not because of the sport- it's because of the people. 

I have seen amazing progress in both body and mind since starting this gym. I have gained friends, confidence, and a much healthier life style. I push myself and my coaches encourage me each time I walk in the doors- they've even checked on me when I missed more than 3 classes in a row (out of my normal routine).

I recommend this gym highly because they take care of you! You are more than a number- you're family! The gym is smaller in size which helps keep the atmosphere friendly and well kept.",5,pI02x6q-E7TEGxeXqZA47A

"Even though I have sworn off the Venetian after they lost our baggage and left me with a bathing suit and cover up only... long story... I do keep coming back here.

"For breakfast in Las Vegas, there is no better place to go. Ya it is off the strip, it is a local place, versus a big casino type environment. However the food is great and the people are real and can see they appreciate you eating there.

I don't know if the guy at the door is the owner or not, I am assuming so as he seems to be the heart and soul of the operation. He was friendly, talkative and made you feel like part of the family and he appreciated you being there. 

You could see the food being made and the whole kitchen staff. The kitchen staff reminded me of gents fresh out of the pen, however they worked hard, looked like they appreciated having a job, looked like they just belonged. I was thankful to them and thought they kicked butt. 

I come to Vegas 3-5 times a year from S. California. If I am alone then no doubt I go to Mr. Mamas at least 1 time for breakfast while I am there. If I can I work to talk friends into coming with me to Mr. Mamas.

"Good food. Good service. I tried one of their local brews that I'd highly recommend ""Legal Remedy, Blonde mocha stout"" yes a blonde dark tasting beer that was oh so good! Very different, but really good! 

I had the Cajun shrimp appetizer it wasn't super spicy, it was good but I'd definitely try something else next time just because I think their menu won't have anything bad. The brisket sandwich was delicious, it's only offered on Thursday's if they have leftover brisket so I figured I had to try it while in town. I had it with cole slaw and the amazing  fried corn on the Cobb, and the black Betty for dessert- a great concept but not well executed. 

I liked the smaller menu you could tell everything was fresh and it all was really very good. Only thing I'd say anything bad about was the dessert, it just wasn't what I expected and wasn't very ""fresh"" like everything else was.",4,NB73HYujVx1LHcCOOOQIRw
"I have a love/hate with Fresco. For the location (rooftop) and view (all of State Street and the Capitol), Fresco gets a five-- it's perhaps the best in those two categories in the city.
However, with what they DO with that amazing space, they get them a 2 or 3. With the fantastic rooftop location and outdoor patio space, they should have more outdoor furniture, a cocktail bar, and a lounge-esque DJ/music set-up EVERY night in the summer (at least on weekend nights). It's really such a shame.
Still, the food is excellent (if not a tad pretentious) and the cocktail menu is nice. They have a fantastic happy hour deal in the summer (Fresco Fives) and they also have a late night-ish cheaper dinner menu sometimes.
While there's really a lot of room for improvement, the location on the top of the art museum and the high quality food and drink still earns them a solid 4.",4,wPr13sTFNCNjubI32naEJA

Today I went with my usual one entree meal which included half in half fried rice/ chow mein and a side of orange and teriyaki chicken. I do like the quick convenience of getting the meal in a supply chain line! The food was as fresh and delicious as always! I also do think they have the best tasting passion fruit iced tea!,4,dW2CE2g42gYEU8k1vl-89A
Honestly - I come from an area which has First Watch (which is just like this place).  So I was hoping to like it.  The decor looks like someones grandmothers home - who was blind - and had bad taste in wallpaper.  Ordered - and waited 45 minutes for food - finally found the waitress who said there was a problem with the ticket.  Imagine my shock when I was informed my order had not been entered...but it would be right up.  15 minutes later (an hour) we ate...food was good but nothing special.  They were very nice and gave us a couple coupons and apologized.  Wont be back.,2,yllm2EH_bVuQVGH7qvB4EQ
"I was looking forward to trying the food here. But nothing stood out.  Chicken wings: over battered and salty. 5 spice chicken: nothing amazing. Oxtail fried rice: different, tasty but not spectacular. Close to $70 for food and 15% tip for lunch. Somewhat outrageous. I'll go for sushi or a good buffet instead.",2,Pjs_W69aQki1JPnvU9ew3w
Double Geo Thermal system that they installed in my home. All the duct work is crooked and three years later I can't find a grate to fit the holes in my walls and ceiling. Nothing but problems with their system and I was informed by Reliance they do not service the Geo Thermal that they sold to me. Buyer Beware. They have their brand name behind them but don't live up to their guarantees and warranties.,1,odayiMuLBOoqiCw0yYkhZg
"Amazing burgers and fries!  I had a classic bacon cheddar beef burger with carmalized onion sooooo freaking good!  The fries cooked in lard with rosemary added OMG the best and the best chocolate espresso shake ever!  I wish we were going to be in Cleveland longer, I would definitely come back!",5,s8b3SZwnM5k6zuZd8IB_6w
"Not impressed. Just because it is mall food court does not mean it has to suck. 

Hotdog was very average. Buns were dry and the dog was not particularly juicy. It can't be what they are famous for, can it?

Fried fish has thick hard batter. I do like the thick cut fries but many of the pieces were over fried. 

Grossly overpriced for the quality.",2,KMuGTu8XeP3_YLt97EjTCA
"Charlotte airport may have some of the best customer service with regards to ticket agents and bathroom attendants, but the TSA agents make it close to the worst. 

I travel out of the airport at least 4 times a month and the security lines can be over an hour wait. On average, 30 minutes. And while you're waiting, TSA agents stand around chatting. I count 12-13 agents at each checkpoint usually and only two lanes open. 4-5 of them looking at the same screen. This is not uncommon! 

I've asked questions, written letters, and have verbally shared my concerns. Not once, have I had a reasonable answer to the hold up. Does our government only hire idiots? 

If you travel thru Charlotte, take some deep breaths before entering.",1,ncHmy_61BAcKgZZtlRKtkQ
"When we got there the place was empty which concerned me a bit but I was hopeful. The food is good,  the prices are decent. Hubby ordered a platter which came with abit of everything.   The fried yucca was good,  the pork didn't seem fresh,  the tamale was ok, I'd say the best were the pupusas. My kids loved them!",4,KsnLigux-r25wvHOUkbSGg

"Essence is the hotel restaurant that serves up a great breakfast. Depending on your hotel frequency, you may be able to get breakfast as part of your stay as otherwise it's fairly expensive for what you're getting. For breakfast, there's eggs, bacon, an omelette station, a machine that automatically squeezes oranges into juice, and a variety of cool goods. 

The server is especially nice and will be very attentive with making sure your coffee cups are full. Great place to eat if youre staying at the Westin.",4,WsHDB2PQnrfY1NRdaw8hjg

"This is beyond the most incredible resort I have ever stayed at. Can't wait to come back! I went here for a quick staycation over the weekend for my anniversary and I couldn't ask for anything more special. The beauty of the resort and the service I received from every single staff member was Incredible! 

Check in is normally at 4pm but I called that morning and the staff was very kind over the phone and found an available room so we were able to check-in at 12pm. All parking is valet so you pull up, and the bell hops will help unload your car and direct you to check in desk. The staff was so nice checking us in and then even greeted us with a fresh glass of champagne. Our bell hop walked us to our room and even explained a little history about the resort. Like it used to be a home in 1922. 

The rooms are large and beautiful. We had a huge soaker tub and a large double shower head walk in shower. We also had a free Keurig in the room and a private patio. My favorite part was the bed! It was so fluffy and felt like a cloud! Best sleep of my life! They do a turn down service at night so they come in and turn down bed sheets, give chocolates, and close the curtains so your ready for bed. We received a gift of chocolate covered strawberries and champagne for our anniversary when we got back to the room. Such a romantic evening. 

This is a very beautiful historic Spanish style resort so very little kids which is nice for a special romantic occasion. There is multiple courtyards that all look different so it's gorgeous to just walk all the pathways and explore. Beautiful lit up at night. There is benches, tables, games, waterfalls, and fruit trees all over the property. Great large pool and jacuzzi which is open 24-7 so you can go anytime at night when it's less busy. They do have a great poolside bar and it's pretty packed during the day. 

Check-out was at 12pm but they are very accommodating so just a quick call down to front office they let us know we can check out at 1pm which allowed us more time to relax in the morning. We ordered breakfast in bed of pancakes and a fried egg sandwich which were both amazing! 

Overall everything from start to finish was amazing. Such a beautiful resort to stay at for a romantic evening and the staff made our stay so special. I'm very excited to come back, if not sooner, at least for our anniversary next year. Next time I want to try the famous T Cooks restaurant on property that I herd great things from. 

Thank you Hyatt and royal palms for making our anniversary so special!",5,pbflAYNWiQKwTLVN_6r4Gg
"By far my absolute favorite bar in Pittsburgh! It's such a hip, young bar where everyone is having a blast. Its totally my scene. The ""frat boys"" you were referencing below are people in collared shirts. Last time I checked, Its okay to go out and look nice, guys. Girls like it when you arent dressed in cargo shorts and a crappy t-shirt. Hellooooo!Haha lots of good looking guys and girls singing and drinking is what I saw. Loved the music and the vibe.

The drink prices are AMAZING especially coming from LA, I recognize a fun,Pittsburgh bar when I see it.  I love the architecture of the building too. My perfect night out involves Carson City in the South Side. Can't wait to come back.",5,Fn5ErHU-STm8KB5MtYauCg
"Tonite I decided to stop in and try this new restaurant and I am so glad I did. I walk in and I'm looking at these tv menus and the by the way the food I rciev d actually looked like the food I was served, The staff was very friendly and offered samples to help me decide which side dishes to order. I ordered a kebab and potato lula combo plate and it was awesome! This place has so many choices and everything was delicious and even healthy. I could only eat half my meal( decent portions) so I have leftovers for tomorrow! I will be back!",5,eC333TVUrEPsFdVHLPp5CA
"I Came on a Thursday evening and the shop was pretty empty. Less than a handful of customers in the shop but 8 staffs over the counter. It was a bit intimidating at first since they were all just waiting for me to place an order. But I could imagine there being a nice assembly system once the shop gets busy in peak hours.  I got a bit indecisive after checking out their menu. They offer prefixed items (some with ice creams, some without) and customized option in which you can build your own by adding toppings for a cost. It took me a bit of time to decide which option to go for but I ended up building my own with a cappuccino waffle base with a scoop of sesame seed ice cream drizzled with chocolate Syrup and sprinkled with icing sugar. Price came to about $8. I originally wanted to try their milk tea waffle but it was unavailable at the time. I was surprised to find their cappuccino waffle to actually taste like coffee. The base was crispy and aromatic with strong coffee flavour in every bite. The sesame ice cream is decent, not really packed with intense sesame flavour but the flavour was there. I'd actually prefer the ice cream to be more flavorful but in my case since the cappuccino waffle was so strong already, the ice cream created a good balance.

Overall, I think I had a great experience and I'd come back to try other flavors when I'm in the area.",3,aS8dUOwPwNi3pvAf0cDoKQ
"THE BEST BUN BO HUE EVER! This place is by far the best Vietnamese restaurant I have been to! The owner, Myles is extremely personable, friendly, and very informative!

I wish I could give this review more than five stars! I will definitely be frequenting this restaurant many times!",5,w-MqcwBI5z8JuwghIDzhMw
"Have visited this place  20 times over the last 25 years. Still good cornbread .The mesquite chicken is good, however it was GREAT 20 years ago. The potatoes are good and they were GREAT 20 years ago-with the right combo of parsley, cabbage, and onion. Somehow the flavor has changed maybe due to recipe changes. It's been 3 years and I will be returning in another month to see what's changed and will update my review accordingly. Service has never been a problem however perhaps the economy has taken it's toll on the ingredients. Can't speak for the drinks - have not ordered any there.",4,e4KOC2oanfpp2fkmGgsPKA

Was given a call about 30 minutes before arrival, and I was shocked when he showed up on the early end of my estimated time frame, that literally never happens with companies anymore! He worked quick but effectively, all while cleaning up any mess left behind. Our carpets look brand new again, not a single stain left behind. The price was also extremely fair, and a serious bargain considering the quality service we received! Will definitely be using them anytime we need cleaning in the future.",5,3BE5Ua74oX9VJNbOn_4zuw

Worst experience ever!!! They want to make as much money as possible in their cover charge. They did not let our group in since we had a few gay men in our group.

"Pleasantly surprised. Although not on the menu, I managed to order a spicy margarita. This is one of the best margaritas I've every had. For this spice loving girl, it came across powerfully spicy while still maintaining a margarita taste.  The pork barbacoa was a hearty well seasoned portion that properly pulled apart with ease. The salsa was a perfect slightly spicy thin consistency. Only the gauc and lack of tinga style chicken knocked this review down.",4,yODLqWjWMTrAwvT_vM-M3A
"There were 4 of us, and the wait was supposed to be 45min to an hour.  We waited next door at camp social (which had very bad customer service)... and 2 hours later there were still 2 people ahead of us.  They were supposed to call when a table was ready.. we left after 2 1/2 hours..  but we still have never received a phone call to say our table was ready(even though we left). Not impressed.  Maybe if we decide to give it another go, it will be better.",1,LxclQ_HqupYb-jMCtIwIWg
"This place isn't trying to be hippie or hipster.  The place is clean.  Almost too clean, but despite that I like the place.  Their coffee is way better than anything Starbucks could aspire to but my preference is their selection of teas.  Strong, hot, loose and full of energy and flavor.

I can't say anything spectacular about their sandwiches. I've only had a breakfast sandwich there once and I was not impressed.  The muffins are good but my favorite would be the Eclairs.  Though they used to replace them every day and I'm not sure that's still the case.

It's not the best coffee I've ever had.  It's not a particularly unique coffee experience, but it's still a decent cuppa at a somewhat reasonable price and best of all it's not Starbucks.",3,g0yTkOngbZAhVmvD7MxcFg

"I have had problems with Rosati's in the past: Really slow, forgetting the dessert part of the order, waiting 39 minutes past when they said it would be ready, and then it was the wrong pizza. So after avoiding them for probably a year and a half I thought I would try again. Once again I waited an hour and a half for them to get my order wrong!  I will NEVER order from Rosati's again. My question is: Does somebody actually run this place? Who's the manager? I have never spoke to someone in charge. The staff always attempts to be helpful, but there has never been a decision maker on site to help out any time I have had a problem. How ever owns this joint needs to take a serious look at who is minding there store because they could certainly do a lot better.",1,x2VGd4p3VAB564YCGPaZxQ

Definitely recommend!! Must get the baked green mussels, pepper seared tuna, and the flaming hot Cheeto roll.

"So we headed to Cibo after a night downtown going to a special event, followed by a movie- then dinner! The good: it was Sat. night and the wait wasn't too long. The pizza and pear salad we ordered was awesome. 
The downside, my fiance ordered the ""calzone pizza"" you can see that this is listed for yourself under the pizza section here: http://www.cibophoenix.com/cena.pdf. Across from it you see the ""Crostone"" which is described as being a calzone. You can see where this is going. They served up a calzone. We asked a gentleman working there about it- he was clueless as to what might even be on the menu- and then made us feel crazy. Then the waitress came over and we asked her and she said that both of those menu items are calzones. Which is strange since one is described as a calzone- they other as an actual pizza. 
She said this happens ""all the time."" 
That's fine but either change your menu, or let someone know when they are ordering it that they are NOT ordering a pizza. I will also say that the pecorino cheese on the pear salad is cut so thick that in the candle light it looked like jicama. The service continues to be bad, we waited time and time again for water, they never asked if we wanted to order more wine, and the check came quickly, but it was with our credit-card on the table for about 20 mins. SERIOUSLY! Also, they seem to have some kind of ant problem in the courtyard- we were bit up before we even ordered. 
ALL of this being said and the food was great! Not so great that I couldn't make it at home if I had all the ingredients- but still VERY GOOD.",3,4VLap4V5R6gnL3sq7aVz7A
"Third time in Holsteins, not so busy got a table on a Saturday for 9 in less than 15 minutes. Their customer service is always on point!

I had the Chicken Limone and my boyfriend had the Creamy Garlic Chicken. There was nothing going on with the food. No seasoning, no anything. Everything was very bland. Looked like it had been sitting in the back a while before the servers got it out to us. The appetizer we had (firecracker rolls) were lukewarm.

"I am here to write exclusively about the Breakfast burritos. As far as price goes, I got a bacon bfast burrito for around 7 dollars (add potatoes, tax included). I don't consider this a good deal. When I grade breakfast burritos I look at three things: meat to egg/potato ratio, flavor, and size. Unfortunately I don't  think this burrito grades well anywhere. There isn't enough meat, you can't taste the bacon, the middle of the burrito tasted like mush, and the burrito overall was small. I would recommend skipping the bfast burrito. It is convenient they have a drive thru and are open 24/7. I can't say much else positively.",2,pHwYBwBrNQZFrfCJ0abA5w

"Mengrai Thai must be one of the most (if not THE most) famous Thai restaurant in Toronto. I use the word 'famous' because they are heavily embellished with awards even from the Thai Royal government and had serviced big screen celebrities like Jackie Chan, Jessica Alba and the list goes on. Head chef Sasi was an iron chef winner and is celebrity status herself.

With such an adorned list of accomplishments, we arrived ready to culinarily enlighten. Once you walk up the stairs into the restaurant, the place has an old antique feeling to it like a mashup of a Thai temple and a traditional diner. A little worn but lots of traditional flair.

Their menu had a lot going on as it was so wordy that it was a little hard to navigate through. We decided to place our full trust in our servers recommendations and ordered the most popular items:

- Tom yum soup: this was the most sour Tom yum I have ever had. The sourness was so overpowering that it was hard for me to enjoy any other flavour that accompanied it.
- Divine crispy morning glory: battered thai spinach, it was fried similar to tempura style with a nice sweet and sour glaze. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend.
- Sasi's red curry chicken with lychee: served in a pineapple and had lychee in the curry, interesting concept but can't say I was a fan. The taste was a little bland and it didn't have a strong flavour profile. The chicken meat was also slightly overcooked. 
- Sasi's pad Thai: the noodles were nice and chewy and it was a solid pad thai but again there wasn't a distinctiveness that would make me want to get it again.

Overall, it was still a satisfying meal and I wouldn't go as far to say this is a tourist trap because I'm sure Sasi is a super talented and great chef. However, our actual experience with the food here dulled in comparison to the glowing expectations of celebrity chef resto.",5,6WyFAEXxUSRU3fy6V4IpgQ

"Drove by a few times and finally decided to place an order.  Walked in and noticed  the place is a little small with 32 chairs and 6 tables.  The person taking the order is fluent in many languages, so no language barrier here.

Bun dac biet (Combo Vermicelli) - plenty of meat, 2 egg rolls and the ngoc mum was great.

Banh Mi Dac Biet - big enough to share, tasted ok as the bread felt and tasted a little stale.

2 Special chicken pho - soup tasted clean, but the chicken was over cooked.

Com dac biet 5 Mon (5 items, grilled pork, chicken, egg roll, shrimp, and Chinese sausage) - kids loved it.

Bot chien - first time and probably our last. It's just fried eggs with crispy.noodle cake.

"This bar is awesome. I love there 4 to 7 p.m. happy hour will you get two for one drinks the drinks are very reasonable and very good. Me and my girlfriend usually go on a Friday to have drinks after work which is very good and relaxing for us help to get rid of all those weekday problems that you've had all week.

I usually get something simple like a whiskey and coke which for 2 for 1 is 2 for $3.50 which you can't find anywhere besides maybe Fremont Street for even one for $3.50. They have great beer specials as well when I do drink beer I use he can get one of those as well and their two for one that's also. My girlfriend likes to get the margaritas which come in a highball glass and they are $4.50. One thing I will say is that the bartenders are awesome they like to talk I like to be interactive and they like to make you feel like you are family which is a great thing for a bar because then you feel like you want to come back and you want to interact with them as well.

I did notice that they have gotten a new cuz I don't know if the cook overnight is the same or if they have change that I do have one problem the last time I went late at night the bartender had to end up helping the cook get our food out quick cuz it took so long and when it did come it wasn't good and it looks like the bartender had actually gone back and cook the food himself because the cook that was back I didn't know what he was doing that was a very late night for us around 4 a.m. so I have not been back that late to see if the Cook has changed but as far as the one that's there during the happy hour he is pretty good and haven't had any problems since I do only go during the four to seven happy hour.",4,_5wmokogLmFzqe7NZ-YvyQ

"Plenty of potential: situated in a historic 3-story Victorian house with a large porch/patio in the heart of Mirvish village. The food is not high quality. Standard pub fare with little flare and poor nacho layering! Each layer must have cheese, please. 

The beer selection is great but the service is just OK. The bathrooms are not up to my cleanliness standard (i.e. i try not to touch anything) and the interior smells of sweaty gym/frat house. 

Its really too bad because the space and location are ideal and the crowd can be interesting at times but at the end of the day, its just a regular pub. Meh.

Every component on the dishes were simply delicious and cooked to perfection. We would definitely come back. I've also been for brunch and that was also wonderful.,5,pzbz0JRU1ImrUIUPI7YdBg
John Khayat at PMI Greater Phoenix is a guy you can really trust. His hard work and dedication to the properties he manages is easy to see. He's a great landlord and an even better representative of those whose property he manages. It's no coincidence he's well-reviewed and has gained such a great reputation within the industry.,5,u7uWDZ5twiEAicciIs5OOQ
"Not a bad spot, but the manager was not the nicest dude in the world. Came right after a run and since I'm from CA I've never had Dunkin' Donuts. My girlfriend and I came in I ordered a coffee and a chocolate donut. My girlfriend asked a question about the smaller donut holes if they had something in them to which the man behind the counter (who appeared to be the manager) kind of dickishly said ""uhh no."" That rubbed me the wrong way she was just asking a question and he could have been nicer. Regardless the spot is clean and the doughnut was good. The coffee was quite good too! I finally see why people like it so much it isn't too sweet, but not too strong either. Overall, not a bad place for coffee and a bite, but the service just wasn't the most welcoming. My whole time there I did not return to this site.",3,YhDBzHqZHOpARR0ZAju77g
"We got late (for LA) into Scottsdale.  Here things just started to pick up...
Our waiter was very helpful.  Really tried to male us happy and even said that.. Explained the menu and also told us he can make any thing we want (my wife likes to have her options...).
We ended up with fantastic house bread, very tasty salad, great veil Milanese!, spaghetti meat balls from great Kobe beef.
Dessert was a bit disappointing but is was part of a special week deal. 
The price was also much cheaper that we have paid at home.",4,ovToHHDkzwCl0nEyd8PP_g
My boys approved. Husband was happy with food selection. Clean place and excellent service.,5,bhi1bnTY8SL_TBwIUXQ2XQ
"I grew up in the South, so I've had some great ribs. When I saw the rum and coke sauce ribs on the menu here I thought it sounded interesting and I gave them a try. They were phenomenal! Seriously like the best ribs I've ever tasted.

The key lime pie was also tasty and my husband and I enjoyed great cocktails, as always. All in all, a wonderful meal!",5,BDdOrPKh6GD9UZFmrkm86g
"we live right around the corner so it's awesome. 
it's clean, it's bright.. and decorated really fun.

they have all the usual flavors like vanilla, chocolate, mango tart... and offer a plethora of toppings;  fresh fruit, granola, all kinds of cereal, candy.. you name it.

what really won me over:  a comment card!  i filled out a comment card and suggested they add coconut yogurt... and a month later i came back and there it was!  with my comment card posted on the wall!  

it was nice.. it really made me feel like they take their customers thoughts into consideration.  we will definitely frequent this joint!",5,IMYpqx2jUlfsr25la-4K6g
"The best. Always the a great spot to grab a snack ( bao ) or a nice lunch ( banh mi ). All the options I've tried are great, you can never go wrong. Personally, I like the 5 spiced pork belly banh mi/ bao or the fried chicken bao. I usually get the kimchi fries and split it with a friend.",5,WmL0gS1WN1ZFcZGGzJ_Ukw

"It's a shame I really wanted to like this place. 

The good: Showed up  Friday night without a reservation, the host seated us rather quickly Server was great explained the menu in great detail.

The bad: While waiting for our appetizers German Osio (the owner) came by to introduce himself. He was slurring his words and seemed drunk. During our meal we noticed German get into an altercation with a guest that was sitting close by.  German followed the guy outside. My girl was curious to see what happened so she stepped outside. She saw German choke the guy and then saw the guy punch German in the face knocking him out cold! The police and ambulance showed up it was a huge scene. For this guy to own two other restaurants in the valley he is highly unprofessional. I've never witnessed such animalistic behavior before, especially in Scottsdale. All in all food was mediocre but it might just have been the owners behavior that ruined our experience. This place won't be open long if German keeps up this behavior, I will NOT be back.",1,-KZi0e9WUd07JYbuTUdm7w
"I'm going to slow the hype train on Trader Joe's for a bit. The produce, seafood, and the meats are pretty gross compared to what you find at Metcalfe's or Whole Foods. (Not to be a wet blanket, but frozen ""organic"" chicken breasts preserved in some ""special"" preservative doesn't inspire confidence.)
Trader Joe's is best for stuff like nuts and raisins. People I know have also recommend fruit juices, which I don't drink because I'm trying to limit sugar, and also liquor, but I don't drink so I can't speak to that.
Layout of the store is great with plentiful underground parking!",3,EYP_u1bvS5sAUPoEkMna-w
"This is the best bbq I can say I've ever eaten in the valley.  It could go up against some of the best BBQ joints in the US. I'm talking places all throughout Texas, Memphis, etc.  I had the 2 meat platter w/Beef Brisket & Pulled Chicken.  The meats are so tender, perfectly seasoned & cooked that you don't even need BBQ sauce; but the BBQsauce is also amazing and adds a lil pop & dimension to the flavor profile of the perfectly flavored meats.

The sides were also not your typical quick, thrown together sides like most places which use prepackaged, bagged & bottled ingredients.  I had the Mac & Cheese - no question that this is homemade (awesomely creamy & perfectly cheesy, not overwhelming-just perfect) & for my 2nd side I had coleslaw. I was totally & absolutely pleasantly surprised. The Coleslaw was also homemade, not bagged cabbage (it was freshly, hand chopped) & mixed w/a homemade, fresh & excitingly flavorful dressing of delightful perfection (not too thick & creamy, yet not too watered down, either - finally after all these yrs ... I've found a coleslaw that has a perfect balance in the dressing consistency, a perfect flavor profile & is made w/fresh, hand chopped cabbage & I can finally say that it's the best slaw I've ever eaten).

My spouse had a full rack of baby back ribs which he couldn't stop raving about.  Ate the entire rack in 1 setting. The meat literally just fell right off the bones.

If you're on the North side of Phx- - -trust me when I say this is a Restaurant you MUST visit.  It will NOT disappoint.",5,GaGdqLVZLFqYUQ7kSONofQ
"Do NOT bring your high end shoes here!!!!  They did such a TERRIBLE job on my YSL tributes, Nordstroms decided to replace them!!! I dropped off 4 pairs of shoes at Nordstroms  (YSL & louboutins) to have new heel taps replaced and cleaned up and the owners son talked me into putting soles on them for added protection from wear... DO NOT do it! I wish I took pictures of the workmanship.. They basically filed down the sides of the shoe and left it without paint...they are 1000$ shoes.. RUINED!!! Not to mention leaving INK marks on them which couldn't be removed because they were patent. Horrible blend job on the underside where the new sole was placed.. Again, even Nordstroms was applaud by their work. I wish I could give zero stars! 

Customer service at Nordstroms deserves 10 stars, they are always helpful with great customer service!!",1,BTuBleSGeAK8VQljE7nOzw
"So Ford and this dealership has a real scam going.  The have figured out that if they call their ""loaner"" cars ""rentals"" and set up a fake rental car desk next to their service then they can get you to pay half the ""rental fee"" even when it's a total warranty issue.  What a total scam.  I will never go back!!!!!!",1,HkqwBazUQN7ZhkWpSGu-Mg

"I loved this place! You can see just how diverse Toronto is just in these few blocks. There are so many cool, unique shops and restaurants. Some of the shops are vintage clothing shops with a bit of a thrift store feel. Others are quirky knick knack shops, or specialty shops. There are even some produce stands that make it a little like a farmers market. 

Even if you don't want to shop or eat. There is plenty of really cool street art all over the place here.",5,rMqOrhSGeLl4ot5qdWA1WA
"1st experience:
I was introduced to this place by my aunt during our holiday trip to Vegas. It's always sooooooooooo much fun going with the fam. My friend joined me that year and agreed that Hot N Juicy was just that. Since we had a group of 10+ we ordered almost everything on the menu except for the crawfish and lobster. I probably ate my weight in shrimp and crab. The side dishes were a mere afterthought. I did enjoy the corn and rice. Come on, I had to have some rice with the proteins!
2nd experience:
""Dude, I think the guy at the front is hitting on you."" Our waiter proceeds to act awfully friendly to my co-worker. We picked on him for the rest of the evening. It was cute!
I was in town for a convention for work. My boss treated us to dinner here. I was so excited since I already knew what to expect. We all ordered our own crab and shared shrimp and sides. The Hot N Juicy special sauce all the way! I learned the ways of H&J.
Last notes:  If you're in it to win it, go for the H&J special sauce mild. Medium to me seems too spicy, but that's just me.  I'm the type that can't handle Hot Cheetos....This place gets super crowded so it's best to try to get there before the dinner rush if you can.",3,dKn-lEX-dvtKm25K3CtBUA
"Cute small airport for an international one, the McCarren has everything you would need if you are stuck in an airport and needed something. Need? What can you possibly need?

Slot machines. And slot machines in rooms where you can smoke.

Yes, Sin City has slot machines for you while you either wait for you flight or wait for your baggage claim. Why? Why are you feeding to my gambling addiction? (Okay, I don't really have a gambling addiction, but still...)

The only other thing I would like to point out is that half the restaurants and stores shutdown down once it's past 10pm. So much for the city that doesn't sleep.",4,eKj7O6grduyIfzhmkyzD8A
"Terrible experience and mediocre food. The line up was long but I trusted that it would go quickly from reading other reviews. I put in my order in advance while waiting, paid my money and then waited...and waited... And waited. It was literally ONE HOUR from the time stamp on my bill to when I got my order of fried calamari. Meanwhile waiting in the humid, cramped, seating area whilst the staff shouted out orders and reminded the crowd of people to move down... I lost my appetite by the time the food finally arrived. We ate through the box of tasteless (but tender) calamari to be greeted with a huge POOL of oil at the bottom. So gross. But hey, the marinara sauce was good.

Someone needs to open a seafood restaurant in SLM so we have another option other than this place.",1,lhG1erIzbQeFsoVtIy3u2Q
"My husband bought a pearl white 2006 Subaru STI from here back in 2008. The brakes were completely gone within a couple days of him buying it and he had to shell out extra money to get them replaced as they are brembo brakes (not cheap!).  While the brakes were being replaced (at Subaru), it was brought to our attention that the sway bar had broken because it was upside down! Carmax refused to cover the broken sway bar under the warranty because they said the sway bar would flip if taken over a jump and that was not warrantied. What a joke. Don't get me wrong, I love to do jumps in a car with no brakes, makes me feel alive - but this car was not jumped nor driven in such a way that the sway bar could've flipped. It was probably upside down because the previous owner that killed the brakes had some aftermarket junk on the car that he took off before trading the car in and since Carmax apparently doesn't look at sway bars and brakes while inspecting their vehicles, it just flew under the radar. This dealership was the last straw as far as used cars for us. Now we save and buy new.",1,v9jtWLYwxgQiBEK-WemqXQ
"Great facility. Great location. Great parking. Great staff. 
They rotate the lifeguards every :15 so they stay alert. 

Not sure who or why they authorized a dog swim on Sept. 11. That really grosses me out, no matter how much chlorine they dump into the pool.
Why, why, why would you ever do that?
_____

I wish they had longer hours to swim laps without the ""family"" atmosphere. ""Family Swim"" equates to lots of kids doing cannonballs all over the place, gettin' in the way while you're trying to do laps, making off with the equipment you may have hanging out at the end of your lane. Huge bummer. But if you can grab some time without the annoyance of the little ones, the place rocks. $3 entry per swim (not per day). 

IMHO, 5 stars if:
* $3 per day (not per swim).
*Fire the dude who authorized the dog swim.
*Clean the locker rooms once in the middle of the day (pretty scary by evening).
*Family (kid) swim limited to an hour a day, twice a week. Outside. Maybe in another county.",4,JR1RJpF0EaoHAbqE0uN4nw
"I had higher expectations for this place since the reviews were so good. We went for dinner around 5 pm and felt like were being rushed, the waitress kept harassing us to order our food even though we had probably sat for 5 minutes. None of the staff were friendly. After we did order our food we received it within 7 minutes, which made me think it wasn't very fresh and it didn't taste fresh either. I ordered the Garganelli Geppetto, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. I had a lava cake type of dessert which was actually really good and I enjoyed it. That was the only good part. Would not be going back here.",2,bcGwJYxHjK5Hr7Dz6DhBBA
"We walked from our little neighbourhood to the next one to try another microbrew place, because, you know, you can never try enough microbrews!
It was a not-so-sunny-it-might-rain-not-sure-oh-here's-the-sun-oh-wait-it's-gone kinda weekday but as we arrived around 6.30 the place was nevertheless packed (inside and out). Ok, fine, it must be good then! 
As I'm freezing (no, literally) under 25degrees, we headed in and triumphatly we managed to elbow-wrestle our way to an empty table squeezed in between other tables ""Oops sorry didn't mean to leave my derriere in your food but I like didn't have a choice if I wanted to get to my seat! Looks good though!""
Beer menu is very interesting with their own brews and food menu although short is mouth-watering with good food and vegan option which as always doesn't come cheap.
We shouted our order to the waitress (see reason below) and got a blonde and a white beer, the Tempeh sandwich and the cheese board. We found nothing exciting with any of it and for the price, were still hungry.
The staff is courteous but no more. The atmosphere is really loud from the over-loud volume of the music and everyone trying to shout over it to be heard by their table companions. Plus, seriously, did you have to dim the light to ""darkness level"" at 7pm!? If you want me to pay I will need to find my hand first and eventually, I know you love me, but I will have to find the door to go home!",3,mrf7q9dBS9TguuYDxlCqCg

After returning from checking their inventory, we were told that the wine is not stocked and also their competitor (total wine and more) also didn't have it in stock according to their website. I checked the website, and it was in stock. I won't do business with a company who lies to their customers in an effort to try and make another sale. Shame on you Bevmo.",2,TjrcRswbxX-VCVWjhW867A

The shop itself has a perfect layout to accommodate customers moving in and out. The flavors are spectacular and apparently change all of the time. My personal favorites were Salted Oreo and Dunkaroos (shoutout to my favorite snack in the 90's!). Job well done with this place. I wish we had one in Nashville!",5,Qb7nbHoHcmHajokRNnbNKw
I was referred to this place by a friend who lives in Vegas. I will say after you are in the glitz and glamour of the strip the outside of the Palace Station will have you second guessing your decision to come there. I actually decided to go during a dog show which made it even more interesting. I was told that there would be a wait but it was worth it. After standing in line for almost an hour and a half I will say that the gumbo i had was one of the best gumbos i have ever tasted. I have friends from New Orleans and this topped theirs. The oysters i had were steamed just right. Horseradish sauce had just the right twang to it. If you have a car in Vegas definately go here. It is even worht the bus and cab ride from the strip.,5,gKfHOr8s92Q3oPWQkXwAXQ

"I went here for the first time with some friends a few days ago and was not disappointed!! My server, Andrew, was very attentive and was super nice. I ordered oysters and a few others that were all pretty good. My daughter ordered the crab mac n cheese and fries and although the mac n cheese looks like a small portion, don't be fooled! She was full halfway through the plate. Some orders my friends did not like, but everyone has different taste buds. The bill came and was a whopping $300. Get ready to splurge if you eat here.",4,LA0kKIHgZmfl2S_OOmU0rw
"This was my first time doing the tea time and so glad I popped my cherry at this place. Totally swanky tea lounge on the 23rd floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel. Very quiet, relaxing and peaceful environment (keep in mind I went on a Monday afternoon though. I am sure it's busier on the weekends!)

We got the English Tea set and I ordered the Green tea w/ lychee flavors. The tea was quite good but it got lukewarm after a few minutes which is my pet peeve - I love my teas pipin' hot! The finger foods were very high quality but most of the items contained items I am not a huge fan of (e.g. smoked salmon, curry chicken, etc). I actually was hoping for more simple cucumber/ham sandwiches since they go so well with the tea and are easy to eat!

The dessert was a total miss for me. Way too sugary and sweet for my palate and I barely touched them. I would prefer more finger sandwiches in place of the sweets! Overall, service was great too and the server was very attentive.",4,-cVb7CK0af_HB5E-VtbNmg
"Nice service staff, half assed effort on the food. Chicken Parm didn't taste so good...ala Peyton Manning. Grilled cheese sliced cheese not melted and bacon was a joke, wings didn't get done on a few and daughters salad was returned inedible. Got money back for that one, thank you very much!
Not sure if the restaurant is failing and can't put together a decent effort or if that's the way it always has been. One and done for us.
Better stuff out there to spend 60+ bucks for family of 4.",2,7kF5-3ukhz154jHUBI3XPg

"We came here a couple weeks back on a Thursday night during TIFF.  The atmosphere was friendly when we came in.  The decor is beautiful and rustic.
However, the moment we ordered we were ignored and forgotten about all night even though we were sitting beside the hostess.  We ordered a lot of food and none of it was spectacular.  
The Portuguese Mac and Cheese was bland and unremarkable.  There was not a lot of seasoning and nothing special about it.  
The Shrimp Po' Boy Sandwich was waaay over seasoned.  The sauce had a weird taste and was just salt city.  Half of the shrimp was well cooked the other half was overcooked. The only good part of the sandwich was the bread.  
The slider platter was supposed to have three distinct flavours, but everyone agreed that it all tasted the same.  The burgers themselves had a funny spongy quality about them which made it off putting. 
The Goa Chicken was an entree which was twice the cost of an appetizer, but was the same size as an appetizer.  We were almost done dinner and had asked twice about the dish before it finally arrived.  The sauce was not spicy or flavorful,  and the texture of the chicken mimicked the rice.  There was nothing special about this entree and we all agreed it wasn't worth the money.  
The pierogies were super sweet for a savoury dish and the dough had a strange texture to it.   It was too much dough and not enough cheese and potato.
We all agreed that we wouldn't ever step foot in this place again.",2,85KECyx4Ugi6Fw0o7A2iJQ

"This is my kinda place. A creepy staircase leading up to a hidden shop with
interesting finds galore. The staff has great taste in music, and the shop specializes in underground and avant garde. You'll also find a good selection of metal, jazz, and an odd assortment of used records and CDs. Prices on new stuff seemed to be $1 or $2 cheaper than anywhere else. I picked up a couple of Severed Heads re-issues, Tame Impala live versions,  another copy of the Top Secret soundtrack for a gift, a handful of 80s 12"" singles and an amazing 2LP Pye Corner Audio which I overheard in the store.

"**I'm posting this again, because I guess I posted the first one to the wrong light rail?**

I have taken a ride on the light rail a few times now and I have some stories!! The first time I rode the light rail I took it from Mill Ave to Phoenix to see the D-Backs and Cubs play. My friends had caught a tram in Mesa so I sat there and watched a few trams come and go before I got onto the one with my friends on it. That was easy enough...there was enough room for me and the ride was smooth and fun (though I can't say it was relaxing)...Any ways. After the game was quite an experience! The tram ride home was a little more crowed now that the game had let out. There were two die hard fans in our car from the two teams who started talking trash to each other...well one of them had a little too much to drink and one thing lead to another and they were soon yelling threats at each other. Right before the drunker one took a swing (in a very crowded car) an older man stood up and shut them both up before someone got hurt...the tension in the air was thick the whole way back to Tempe where the Cub fan got off and punched the window. The friends of the other guy had to hold him back...I mean come on!! 

Okay, then I had the pleasure of using the light rail to go to the Circus. Again I was headed to Phoenix but this time I got on at the Washington stop. It was again a fun ride, but I couldn't say that it was a relaxing ride...there was this bum who was asking people for money and I think it would be better with some music playing in the background...any ways the ride home wasn't as eventful as the baseball game crowd, but again, there was another bum asking for money...can people just ride in peace?

I like the light rail - I really do...it's always an interesting experience, but I just don't feel safe on it. I used to take the metro bus from Gilbert to Mesa every day for a while and I felt safer on that then I do on the light rail and the bums who ride the bus don't ask me for money either.",4,4yAIbaDGbl00Krcv4d5-qg
STAY HOME AND SAVE YOUR MONEY!   or go elsewhere if you want good food.  Ordered a corned beef sandwich a Reuben  2 onion soup and mozzarella sticks for take out was $43.00 asked for xtra pickles on side DIDNT get any asked for mustard on side DIDNT GET ANY asked for xtra 1000 island dressing DIDNT GET IT.  Corned beef was dry and bland bread was stale sour kraut was like eating dental floss! Thankfully they put very very little on it. And cheese was non existent. As far as I could tell neither of us wanted to finish or save what was left of our very small sandwiches. The only good thing about them was that they were small. Cuz if they were really big and had to throw away more than half the sandwich I would be pretty peeved Mozzarella sticks were ok but hardly worth the $$  they charged and somewhat undercooked  soup was only good thing we got. Webb sight says to inform hostess you are there to pick up an on line order I did so and was rudely told take out orders were to be picked up at the bar. Bar maid was very nice.  Food was ready and that was the only nice thing about my visit here.,1,xbGYvdpw6KI_jVm4Va3SqQ

"We were suppose to have dinner he pre-theater menu but they said we should have been there from 6:30p even though when we called for reservations we were told just show up with our tickets. We ask to speak to the manager which I think is actually  the maitre d, who said there's nothing he could do. So we ordered from the main menu. 

Well what I thought would be a bad experience turned turned out good based on the service the waiter gave us. We had ordered a bottle of wine and when it was finished he asked if we wanted to order another, we said no but her showed up with a bottle of red wine and said it was on him. He then made sure we each got desert when we only ordered two and apologize for us not getting to order from the pre-theater menu.

kabocha squash soup = 3/5
triple desert dish = 4/5 (root beer float is the best)

"Stop.....do not walk through their doors.  They will insist you need some sort of major work, have an infection or pending problem and the dentist may or may not even look into your mouth to make this diagnosis.  I don't know if there office was ever very good.  But I do know that my kids do not have many cavities and they are not very excited to see them.  The adults on the other hand, need deep cleaning, anitbiotics to kill infections, extra x-rays, crowns, you name it.  

I thought maybe my first experience was a fluke, so I went back.  Dentist never looked in my mouth and it had been a year and a half, but insisted I still needed the same 4 crowns they had recommended prior.  Meanwhile, I still have those teeth.  Upsell, upsell, upsell.

The staff stands around and talks about the patients and the Dr. rounds the corner to ask the office girls how many they got today.  Referring to major procedures that called back to schedule. And wheres the respect for patients privacy?

Do not let them touch your teeth or your childrens teeth.  Save your money and find a better office.  

Melanie certainly could brush up on her customer service skills.  When we called back after they had problems and couldn't finish my husband's appt. (claiming they would call him back), she was short, rude and unhelpful.",1,6Gy7L7U7jAdL1OFzDrCjzQ
"Pretty good Greek food with above average Garlic Sauce and Greek Fries. The rest was pretty much middle of the road in quality. That garlic sauce is out of this world and truly the best Greek Fries ever.

Would get another star if it wasn't $13.99 for such a small plate of food.",4,Sx_PLOCUBZdtDV6-YuQm3w
This place is wonderful!  Every time I get my nails done I am always received with big smiles and excellent service.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants great service and nails that last a long time.  I would highly recommend either Ivy or Debbie to do your nails.  I always call ahead and make an appointment but walk-ins are welcomed.,5,7WeP_EEnmr9kirj3Dle8KQ
"We are very happy that we found Lash. The service is very high quality and we appreciated the attention to detail. The rooms are clean and the staff was very friendly. Megan and Ashley were so helpful in explaining the value and benefits of the Lash membership. 

We had a slight hiccup on our first visit, as a business  owner myself, sometimes employees need a bit more training and that is just part of running a business. Sometimes issues arise, I don't judge a business, if there is an issue, I judge a business on how they handle an issue. They resolved the issue in a fair and reasonable way. They are working hard to make this place great, which I respect. Because of that, I believe that they have earned five stars.",5,Wt_-expj4hhxEUYqKkCAIg

"Since the change of new owners, this place is GREAT again! The atmosphere is better...and it looks cleaner. The food is amazing...especially the spinach artichoke dip. I have to get it each time I go! Try the Friendly Fries with your meal. They're yummy too!",5,0y_Bje8r0naS2IdZd6exmQ
"I'm kind of an idiot and went here for the dessert and then I didn't have any. Soooo yeah. 

We showed up to wait for a table (mind you there are about 45 tables open outside and we were okay with eating outside). The hostess said it would be a 15 minute wait anyway (why? I don't know). So we're sitting outside by the door and near a fan. We've been waiting for a while and I get up to go check to see if they called our name. Apparently the hostess did (inside? she knew we were outside) and since we weren't there crossed us off the list and moved us to the bottom. She was also very rude to us about it. 

Whatever, no big deal. I'll take your attitude, just seat me, I'm starving. 

Finally after waiting for a few minutes (this time I stood near their hostess station so they knew I was in existence) and my party was seated. Naturally it was uncomfortably hot but we were seated in probably the worst area. It was so hot, I was disgustingly (and embarrassingly) taking ice out of my drink and letting it melt on my legs. :hangs head in shame:

Our waiter was very nice and made up for the hostess. I wanted lunch and asked for something ""small."" Apparently their tuna salad was the smallest salad but this thing was massive!!! It was very good, but I'm still cautious about getting fish in the middle of the desert. 

Anyway, no dessert. I think if I was back in Vegas and wasty face, I'd make a stop to try the dessert. Otherwise, I probably could get bitched at by a hostess at a snootier restaurant and feel less bad about it.",1,njdzwHuPGOq_Bemqf-_z0g
"Here for a private party in the back area. 
Small diet Coke & Barcardi, $8! 
The guac was very good.
The flautas/rolled & fried tortillas were also good.
But the rice and black beans, lackluster.
Two types of wings served: dont know flavors but one with a rub tasted like it had cinnamon (not on my wings!),  the other was good.",3,ITA2AQ313mhkP9fuxaPwdA
"Awful experience. Came here for my sister's birthday. Good thing women were free, but damn it would suck to be a guy. My husband ended up paying $125 at the door. First dj was awful & played music that were slow and un-danceable at the beginning. A coke & rum cost a freaking $16 and it wasn't even a tall glass!! Dance floor was too packed and it took me 15 minutes just to leave it. I think several fire codes were violated that night. Main dj (Hardwell) didn't come on until 1:30 pm, at which time it's impossible to even move in the dance floor. Ridiculous prices. Totally not worth it. Hakkasan was a total dud & disappointment. Would not recommend unless you're planning to purchase one of their even more expensive table service.",1,MOkaECWMWvJy0kYQlFsdAA
"Called the salon to advise the owner that my polish had come off of two of my nails WITHIN 24 hours and she never apologized, blamed it on the polish and hung up on me.

"Wife said she Walked in mid-afternoon on a recent Friday for first time.  She walked in and asked if there was a wait for mani-pedi. Gentleman who greeted her said no wait and took her right to pedicure chair. Water temp was tepid at best and quickly got cold water (yuck). 

She waited...and waited. 15 minutes, 30 minutes. She finally asked the man as he walked by how much longer. He said 5 - 10 minutes.  She explained that She would have come back later or another day if the wait was going to be any longer. 

20 more minutes and She finally got up, toweled off and walked out. 

Very poor experience. Won't be back.",1,-gb6QxAMlWpF9NjvYPDzsw
"I friggin love NAGA!! I have eaten there as many as 4 times a week for lunch! Would do 7, but I spare my husband's off days to avoid a money smart lecture ;) . Any who! I always order the yellow Curry with beef. Its divine darling! So coco-nutty and deelish! I also have tried the combo pad Thai (up charge for combo meats) Fried rice, Tom Yum Shrimp, as well as the Thom Kai chicken! All of which are WWW dot THABOMB dot com! 

Now the only reason I deducted a star is because they mixed my order up two times now! I sucks to get home to what I thought would be sweet succulent, juicy, and o sooo divine -d literally lol) shrimp, but get ground chicken .. (aaahhhhhhh mannnn) Or, nothing like expecting beef and get chicken chunks (NAGA -2 Joy- goose egg!!) . Hence, I am deducting a star! (witch laugh).

"Le Mont just lost $30,000 tonight.

Me, my fiancé, and her mother went to Le Mont for dinner tonight in hopes of locking down a date for our wedding venue next year. Well, I definitely would have thrown my money at them if I wanted countless disappointing memories and an over the top, pretentious, unprofessional, outdated venue.

Le Mont reminds me of a restaurant that made it big in the past with presumably good food, service, and professionalism while of course being complemented by the unmatched view of Pittsburgh. However, complacency must have set in because all of those characteristics were lost along the way.

Upon arrival, we were not greeted with even a hello. We were standing waiting for our table while one of the staff members motioned over to us (while standing deep within the restaurant) to come follow him. If it wasn't for my fiancé paying attention his efforts would have been useless, while remaining devoid of professionalism.

Our waitor clearly lacked proper training for a place of this caliber. Nothing against him, but if you work hard during the week to go to a restaurant and pay hundreds of dollars for dinner, you would like a waitor that is professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. For example, he asked me if I would like another cocktail as it was 3/4 finished. I said yes as I proceeded to finish it; meanwhile he waited behind me as I finished the drink and said: ""Oh I'm just waiting for you to finish so I can make you another drink in the same glass."" WHAT!??!!?

I ordered the filet mignon and said I wanted it between medium and medium rare. His response: ""Well I'll just have them cook it medium rare and if it's undercooked for you I'll have them cook it a little bit more."" WHAT!??!!

The side vegetables were 100% frozen and just came out of the microwave, and lacked any effort of seasoning to help disguise its origin, the grocery store shelf.

When it was time for dessert, they brought out a food cart of half eaten cakes that looked like they had been raided by a hungry pack of wolves. But, in any attempt to salvage the night, me and my fiancés mother ordered a slice of cake. The waitor asked my fiance if she wanted anything and she said no because she was full. His response: ""You sure you don't want nuttin?"" WHAT!??! 

I ordered a cappuccino which lacked foam and had burnt coffee inside. To top it off, the plate was ""beautifully garnished"" with a shriveled, small, dirty, lemon peel. ""Yes, I love lemon with my coffee."" When I confronted the waitor about it, he indeed confirmed that it was a garnish. WHAT?!?!?!?!!? 

The bathrooms were dirty, floors were sticky, wall paper was peeling, and outdated. On the way out, no ""have a good night, thank you for coming, etc"" was said. Pretty fitting though - with this poor excuse for a 5 star restaurant I would expect nothing more: lack of professionalism, mediocre precooked food, and ridiculous comments about lemon peels, but definite willingness to take your money.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT. IT NEEDS GORDON RAMSEY, OR A BULLDOZER. SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ELSEWHERE.

JUST GOOGLE THE VIEW.",1,-bizFU0PqFCqoRD5_oazDA
"This place is GREAT! In LA, $100 a month to climb at Boulder Dash or virtually any indoor climbing gym. This place is $120 for 3 months! And $10 a month for a gear rentals. They have one big Boulder with all levels of climbing surrounding it. Most of it is inverted which was hard at first since I haven't climbed in about 6 months. But, after a day or two you get the technique to keep your body on the wall. They also have a few auto belays and tons of top rope routes surrounding the building. I saw a guy on a slack line doing some crazy acrobatics in the corner so I guess they let performers practice there to. I'm glad I became a member I go almost everyday now. Come on thru and climb sometime! Friendly people, friendly staff, great prices, and whoever picks the music station has the vibes on point.",5,UxPYPaQUBSRmykIAWT9gNg
"My sister in law had just given birth and I called for a burger and the grill was closed, but they made a burger special just for her !!!! Best burgers on Roncesvales !

DAMN GOOD",5,J9U6Z1zV2vCau09lVQAUfg
"This place was HORRIBLE. I am in town for business and I was here at the office and called in an order to be delivered. They told me it would be forty-five minutes to an hour before it would get here, no problem, it is what it is. After waiting for TWO hours my very polite coworker called to inquire about our order. A man answered the phone and she said, ""I was calling to check on an order"", without asking for a name or what we ordered he said, ""it's on its way"", and he HUNG UP on her. What a bastard!! 15 to 20 minutes later the delivery guy showed up, he was very nice. We couldn't accurately judge if the tardiness was his fault, so unfortunately he was tipped well. After exchanging the money and food we walked to the back because we were starving at this point. My coworker and I have a security camera system set up and we noticed the delivery guy hanging out in the lobby. We stood there and watched the guy pace our lobby pick up a few magazines, flip through them, watch the TV for a solid minute. My coworker and I were actually laughing. At this point being mad wouldn't make it better. However sharing my experience on Yelp would potentially help the next guy know not to order from here for Delivery. The food was was almost room temperature. The cashew chicken that I had ordered had very little chicken (I had to hunt for it to make sure there was any even in the dish!). It didn't lack giant chunks of onion. I like onion, but damn! A coworker had sushi that she didn't even eat after a few pieces, saying it was not good. I did try it, I didn't like it, but that opinion can be taken with a grain of salt due to the fact I'm not a fan in the first place.  -3 stars is my real rating. -1 star for the bastard -1 star for the smug delivery driver and last but certainly not least -1 star for the shitty food.

*** I do notice that others have rated it well, so maybe we caught them on a bad day, but diners-beware!!***",1,G-C82KPCH-PVYg6TvRea4w

"Ordered the Lamb Tika Masala Roti.  Lamb itself was decent, tender a bit fatty which is good as most places the meat tends to be really dry.  However, there was very little of it.  I would say percentage wise when you order a roti, 60% of it is the roti, 30% sauce, 5% potatoes, and 5% lamb.  the taste itself was okay, the roti nothing special.  At $14 I'd just be thinking about how little protein I'm buying.",3,o59m4qmx31OdH3r3z5uJcg

"I went to Karben 4 after hearing about it from a friend. My interest in craft beer, prior to my visit, was almost nonexistent. A couple friends and I sat down at a table surrounded by beautiful paintings suspended from the ceiling. We sampled all varieties, including the spectacular Nightcall smoked porter and Silk Scorpion Black IPA. Having never tasted a porter, I wasn't sure what to expect but was surprised by its flavor and pleasant aroma. Additionally, my friends and I tried a few menu items including a summer sausage sandwich and the homemade pretzel. Both were excellent. I recommend Karben 4 to all beer drinkers, period. One more thing, the music played in the taproom was excellent. It wasn't too loud, and I was still able to hold conversations without shouting at the top of my lungs. I'll be back.",5,iskV4e7RONUvnIxwSHU-7g
"I absolutely did not know what to expect when I arrived, do I have to physically escape a room? Do I solve puzzles? Am I playing a grown up game of CLUE?  The team at Xterious escape rounded us up and showed us our backstory video, gave us brief and clear instructions and took us to our room. 
     Without spoiling anything I can tell you it's about finding clues and solving puzzles and working together. Our team made it from room to room and escaped with 14 minutes to spare. I was sceptical at first, but it was so much fun. I can't wait to bring the kids. 
     I will recommend that you try to bring a big group, otherwise you get paired with strangers. We lucked out and our new team mates were cool and friendly and NOT MORONS. Some of the props were a little ""hokie"" but if you can get past that it's just good fun.",5,hjVAPJlwB1dL04J4BuFBpQ
"I would recommend this hotel and probably stay here again, but during our last stay, we experienced some problems.  First, the toliet in our room didn't flush. Second, the remote control for the TV in our room worked quite poorly.  Lastly, the Starbucks counter in the lobby was closed for some reason at 10am on a Monday morning. No explanation why, not that it mattered,  The first two things I would have normally called down to the front desk to let them know, but we didn't discover either of them until about 1130pm at nite and at that point we didn't want a plumber in our room or have to move rooms.  So we mentioned it on the way out. Upsides of this hotel are the location and the free parking.  They also offer a free shuttle to many of the hot areas of Madison.  We didn't use it, but it was nice to know that it was available.",2,YL09OY1Pqu-Ju9npofGYPA
"Their Hokkaido milk tea is a new favourite! It has a strong caramel/toffee taste - very sweet so I def recommend getting 50% sugar or maybe even 30%. One of the pricier bubble tea chains but their milk teas are good quality and you can really taste the tea flavour. They currently have white tapioca available too but unfortunately was sold out when I went.

This location is bright and clean, and they have board games available. Would definitely revisit if I'm in the area again and craving bubble tea :)",4,kx5JuRXIRcPnmARhWlgRjQ

The food, was amazing. I got the soba chicken noodle salad (no lettuce) & it was delish. My boyfriend got the hell's kitchen burger & he said it was pretty dang good. 

The oreo shake was the best part, whatever you decide to get, make sure you get a shake. They are phenomenal!",5,XF9kQT2SCGQCxgyq-sRr4Q
"Friendly staff and a pretty large menu. The beer was average but the Thai Pizza was tasty. The restaurant was pretty busy for being only 5pm. I'm pretty sure happy hour was going on but our waitress never explained it and I'm not sure if we received a discount.

The Thai Pizza was big and relatively spicy. I wish the pizzas were more of a personal size because we would have liked to try a few different options.

Overall, nothing special but it was better than your typical sports bar.",3,j0jfAE2R4ya2gwqzhOQDmQ
If you like moldy sandwiches come to this location! The manager is super rude when I called (not wanting a different one or a refund) but just to inform them so people don't get sick. This place needs to get fined for how disgusting it is.,1,ucjWqgbZsQIXe1mwpcst0A
"Sweet little restaurant with cute decor. The wait staff was friendly and very familiar with the menu options. The homemade apple butter was tasty. I was surprised to find the Sexy Spuds, a staple and highly recommended menu item, to be cold. It was as though they had been prepared much earlier and sat waiting for someone to order them. 
The chorizo gravy was delicious!",4,5l-0aHhK58MRhDfGmU96AA
"I came here for the first time a couple days ago with a huge group of friends. I had high expectations, so that may account for my 4/5 star. Long story short: though this place didn't satisfy me to a 5 star degree (food wise), I was super impressed by the service.

I was SUPER hungry before stepping into the restaurant. I checked in on Yelp for a 10% discount and I was ready-to-go. However, the food, (understandably) took some time (as I went with a large party). Again, I was really hungry. I want to emphasize just how hungry I was in order to reveal the accuracy of my 4/5 review. Despite just how hungry I was, the food wasn't THAT impressive. It was standard in terms of quality and portion.

FOOD:
I got a See Yew spice level 3 (out of 10) with chicken. It was tasty and well-cooked! There wasn't much of a wow-factor though. I tried a bit of my friends' food, and my opinion stands accurate for all the dishes.

ATMOSPHERE:
Spacious. There's a bar area. Lots of seating, not as many customers (I went on a Saturday night). However, it's nice and clean. There's also a sanitary bathroom for paying customers.

SERVICE:
The waitress was really nice and helpful. She was patient and friendly the whole night. Someone from the kitchen, who I presume to be the owner and/or head chef came out to make sure everything was okay ... and that's really telling of how much the staff care.

I would come here again, but the far distance is a turn-off is I'm being completely honest. But my overall experience was positive.",3,oAhZbPYuw8-txYjUYJxViA

"I've recently did a drysuit neck gasket repair with MEC. And it is my first and last time: the experience has been an ongoing nightmare. 

When I first inquired about the repair cost, I was told it'd be $35.00. The repair was done in a timely fashion. When I went to pick it up, the cost came up to $120.00. I was in shock and had to re-budget my rent for this month for this shocking repair cost. But I did pay for it. 

A week later, the same gasket was torn. (And yes I do take care of them, my head is as small as a child and I even sanded down my nails to prevent any harm to the suit gaskets). I was very upset as I just spent all that money and time on it. This is also the time of the year when I need the drysuit the most. 

As there is a repair warranty, I took the suit back to MEC and politely asked for help. The rep at service desk was very pleasant and helpful. And promised to take care of the repair without charge, under warranty and that the suit would be ready in a few days. Later that day, I received a call from a MEC manager to tell me that's not going to happen and accused me of taking advantage of the shop for multiple gaskets repairs and not paying for them. That they do not cover wear and tear. Wear and tear? It was worn 3 times and was torn again! As if it's normal for their service to hold up for 3 wears. Did I mention the drysuit was $1000.00? And the neck gasket can only be repaired/changed 3 times. 

We came to an agreement that they will cover the repair cost but have no idea when it will be repairs as no one at the shop is willing to do it. So my drysuit is currently sitting in the shop without action and I am cancelling all my paddling plans for the next few weeks and a long October vacation trip. The worst part is, everyone who knows about my repair looks at me as if I'm a criminal. I'm the problem, it's my fault all this is happening. REALLY?! WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?",1,Rys-sIjHrOE8mxIOUQGsrA

I went all over Scottsdale looking for a battery, no one had my battery in stock (including Suzuki's road side assistance).  O'Reilly's had exactly what I needed and installed it free of charge.  They also included a 3 year warranty on the battery (most places only offer 2 years).  They also gave me some pointers on how to care for my battery and make it last longer.

"I had a leaking Moen faucet in my kitchen and found out that it came with a lifetime warranty. Moen sent me a brand new one (newest model) within 3 days! I had a yearly contract with an AC, heating and plumbing service from one of the largest (if not the largest) home improvement stores in the country. They gave me a ""VIP price"" of $269 to install it.  I searched the internet and found these great reviews of Arturo the Plumber and decided to call him. He called right back and asked me to text him my address. I sent him my address along with two photos; one of the old faucet and one of the corrosion under the kitchen cabinet, and asked if he could give me an estimate based on the photos. He was able to give me a fantastic estimate about 1/3 the price of my contracted company.  The installation went perfectly and I am now a big fan of Arturo. So, I have learned that big companies charge more and their plumbers work on a commission. This is why it is better to hire a local plumber who can charge a reasonable amount.
From now on Arturo is my man!",5,2ETQPc3jtx76_TyauOJVZQ

"This place looks cool inside and has a fun vibe.  

First the downsides: menu can actually be a little overwhelming, you get the impression the staff is overworked/crazy busy (how long does it take to make tea?) to the point where if there are more than four people ahead of you in line, you want to shoot yourself.  Unless you have nowhere to be, ever.

"Decided to check out this place during lunch because it's near my work. Wanted to give it a shot before I went to any of the alley pro shops because I heard good things about it and coming from a bowling family, I definitely know of David Haynes and I wanted to support his shop. To their credit, they seem to have a good stock on different bowling balls and supplies, but I had a very crappy experience going there. Walked in to browse and see what they had and for a good 10 minutes I walked around and not a single person greeted or even asked if I needed help. There looked to be 3-4 people behind the counter as well so I was kinda taken back by the lack of customer service. Maybe I just came at a bad time, but I can't sugar coat it. Glad to see a local shop doing well, but I'm not sure when or if I'll come back. Didn't see what I was looking for either. Wish their business the best.",1,5wnx8l9JWgNPhts3EjFZBw
Its was a nice hotel but the fact that when we ordered the hotel they never gave us a registration time. Wen whe got there they had attituted with us so we had to go back to tbe car and sleep there because they didnt do anything to help with the problem. And wen we went back to register they told us that the room was gonna be ready until 12. When we went baxk at twelve they told us the room was gonna be ready until 3. So we went to sit down at a couch in the hotel. If it wasnt for someone from security that was tired of seeing us wait so he got us the room. I couldnt believe that if it wasnt for him we would probably still be waitig there.. really dissapointed with the service.,1,LTsPOld1gIeZOmrTPT4qtA

"First time visiting Kasai I enter and there is background music resembling techno; nice upbeat change really. The place is quiet and I have ordered two rolls; A giant Spider and a spicy crab. I am waiting for the meal now.

Ok fast forward about 20 minutes and I have just finished my rolls. Now my favorite sushi spots remain Otani in Mayfield Hts and Pacific East in Beachwood. That said this was really pretty good. I was on the fence with a 3 star but I feel that sends the wrong message, wish they had half stars.  Anyway I would come back for sure as I work an hour from my home town and going home for lunch just would not work.

The staff is friendly and attentive and as I said the food was good. Prices a little high for what you get.

I had the giant spider Maki and while there were several pieces; maybe 10 there seemed not to be much crab. I also had a spicy crab Maki roll and again a little lite on the crab and a sweet sauce over the top that I could have done without.",3,pZiCNG1MGYYC1utqRnLNZw
"A little out of the way, in a small little strip mall located next to a foot massage spot, but a great find.nonetheless.  Mini pot comes with all food precooked, so you miss out on some of the fun of cooking it yourself, but the broth was flavorful and savory with a lot of different flavors to chose from.  Place was clean, and service was excellent with them cheerfully dealing with all the accidents of a two year old boy.",4,PwkfRPYR3ZFFLIPTxIslVg
"I recently took advantage of their $99 special (one hour massage/one hour facial), added an extra hour of massage for only $60 (!), threw in a pedi and enjoyed a glorious spa day. And I mean enjoyed! The location is easy to get to, clean, bright, friendly. Upscale-ish, but comfortable, no pretension. I appreciated the large massage room. I don't like when rooms are so small the masseuse bumps into the table when she/he moves or there's no room for clothes, or, because the rooms are so small you can hear everything going on in the rooms on either side. Not the case here! You'd think with such a fantastic special that the services would be skimpy or cut-rate, but again, not the case! The massage was a combo deep/Swedish by a professional; the facial was thorough with cleansers, moisturizers, masks, extractions, toners...and so relaxing I dozed off. Pedi was a true spa/resort pedicure. Products are available for purchase, but there was absolutely no sales pitch. If you're interested in a product, you'll have to ask. I will be back!",4,EnjNCq1cWJHGtqI83PD3xA

"Good but does not live up to the hipe. 

When I go to a BBQ like this I expect to be blown away but the couple times I have gone, just haven't done it for me. Food is average, and portion sizes are on the small size. If I am picking the restaurant for lunch or dinner, I will not be picking Bubba's Q. 

Not a bad place to go but keep you expectations in check.",3,XFV4R6VeHzcW4JQXZNcYcA
"We came here on a Friday night at 9pm and used a restaurant.com coupon. The restaurant was packed and it was pretty loud...there was definitely alot of hipster energy filling the air.

Here is what we ordered:

Kobe beef carpaccio- OMG WIN! WIN! WIN! The beef was thin and delicious covered in truffle oil, parmesean, and arugula. The portion was really large. I am sorry that I didn't just order 5 plates of this for myself instead of the steak trio...I would have been much happier.

Rare Steak Trio for Two - the trio consists of a filet mignon, new york strip, and kobe hangar steak. We ordered the steaks medium rare but only the filet was cooked properly...we had to kick back the NY and hangar. The filet was like butter and really delicious. It took a ridiculously long time to get our other 2 steaks back. They eventually arrived at the correct temperature but the hangar steak was inedible because it was so stringy and tough.

Rare 120 Herbed Fries - good fries covered in chives, thyme, parsley, and rosemary.

We were celebrating a birthday and they brought us out a trio of mini desserts (german chocolate cake, brownie smores,  and tiramisu) with candles on top which was very nice.

Our server was very friendly, attentive, and professional. The manager came out and apologized about the steaks. Best part of the evening was that they were showing the movie Flashdance on the wall.

Overall it was a good experience but I think I will stick to Craftsteak for my Las Vegas steak dinners.",3,gAcbpBLhQXWaHkJChEFBXg
"Just so you know...my dad first brought me here when I was in grade school and I have been coming back ever since.(I'm 48 now) The best tamales ever!!!! I moved away to Oregon for 13 years and was on a quest... telling people of the awesome tamales I knew in Vegas, I got lots of suggestions but nothing compared to the pork tamales I grew up with, and now that I'm back in Vegas this is a regular stop for me. The rest of their food is OK but nothing beats those Tamales",5,1snG_xfcZIs9gR5zibI0cg
"This restaurant is extremely clean! It is also nicely decorated. 

The food just blew us away it was so good. I got the Lamb Masala medium spicy. It was spot on. The lamb was very tender and the flavor was out of this world. You must order the naan bread. The naan arrived hot right out of the pan and was so nicely chewy.

The service here is top notch too. They actually care about their customers experience. At one point my significant other commented on how spicy the food was and our server immediately asked if it was too spicy. It was not at all, he just loves spicy food lol.

We will definitely be back!",5,hAp24VctqIFjIiNYwAF02g
"OK, so as a new tea drinker I felt I needed to check the place out, even though other Yelpers have given fair warning about the staff and prices.  My 2 experiences have been different from what has been mentioned.  Staff were friendly but not pushy, prices were as expected (they are in a high end mall, folks - the rent must be paid) and the tea was fine.  I liked that they would make a cuppa of whatever they sold (rather than ""this is the flavor of the day"") and even though $4.99 is a bit steep for a cuppa, it is a one-time leaning experience and is helpful in learning whether you want to take this tea home or not.  The only warning I might give is that, in one case, they added a bit of rock sugar to the store sample pot of the mixed chai, so it is sweeter than the actual tea that you might buy.",3,Yn4k3XfCHPB__RmxzfIhtA

"Worst service I experienced in Charlotte. When we first got there the 2 bartenders didn't acknowledge us but instead counted their money in tip jar. After finishing beer one I wasn't offered another beer my glass was just taken away. After my boyfriend finished his beer we waited as the three bartenders talked amongst themselves not even facing their guest. After 6 minutes we had to yell to get their attention to close out. Bar wasn't busy at all their was only one other group at bar. You staff is an embarrassment as your space is cool. Never wrote a review in my life.

"Where do you want me to start!
1. worst customer service ever... The middle age Hispanic woman was incompetent and did not have the basic customer service skills to work the front counter. 
2. My party stood waiting to be seated. After 6 minutes of waiting, we finally sat ourselves. (by the way we grabbed our own menus) 
3. Once we sat and realized the middle aged woman was not going to come to our table to take our order. She then yelled across the room to ""come back to the counter to place our order"" (side eye)
5. At the counter we were met with hostility. We couldn't understand where this hostility was coming from (it was my birthday and I just wanted a pie)
6. The pizza came out SALTY! (see other Yelp! Reviews)
7. The wings were broken and freezer burned

As a self employed person, walk in places don't cut it, a friend of mine recommended KH Finacial and after an in person consult with Patrick who was very patient with my questions and knowledgeable about my needs, I decided to make the switch. This has been my first year using KH Financial and I found it to be far more convenient than I imagined possible. This company comes to you! So handy and efficient, and the same price as my former tax guy.

"""Zarkana"" does not have the the ethereal sets and dream-like choreography of ""Love"". Nor does not have stunning water nymph dances found in ""La Reve"". But ""Zarkana"" is very true to the Cirque du Soleil's roots and early beginnings, and is an enchanting homage to the traveling circuses of yore.

This circus features a poignant collection of delirious jugglers, bawdy clowns, a number of dauntless acrobats who defy physics and human endurance, a defeated mad scientist and his coterie of believers, and a pickled mutated baby that acts as the lead float in its sideshow parade. 

Although the performances in ""Zarkana"" are very much old school and emphasize its audacious acts and astonishing acrobatics, this show is in no way reminiscent of the Circus Vargas that sets up its tent in your neighborhood mall's parking lot. 

It is far more prodigious, where almost every performance will leave you gasping with awe and wonder, and garnished in typical Cirque fashion with ostentatious costumes, a score of pandemoniac songs that both lull and excite you, and eerie video and images that are projected all around its stage that give ""Zarkana"" both a Gothic and Steampunk vibe.",4,0M2C7XPLWKtT7jV65z3-7Q

We are on their mailing list and have been customers of theirs since 2014. We got a coupon emailed to us for 20% off and it was valid . When we got to the store to use it first the lady was too buisy on her cell phone to help us while the man was actually helping a customer. You could hear her conversation. She was carrying on with her friends on her cell. When I actually called her over she hung up and helped us. That is unusual for this store we usually get great help. So we asked about what we wanted and showed her our coupon and she told us other people had been in with the same coupon today but she called the manager and they were not honoring them. We told her the emails came from your store. She said they didn't care they were not honoring the 20% discount offered to there customers for being loyal. That they ment for it to end a day earlier than it said. As a result of this we will never ever go there again. I will not give my money to a place like that.,1,5OA_jHjM5QJor8ZuhUi1ug

Edgepark medical supplies company is my absolute worst nightmare! Every month I have to call in an order for my infant son's formula. Every month I have to fight with them in order to get the order shipped to me. The first thing I'm told is they denied the order because they don't have the medical necessity on file yet after fighting with them they review the file and find out. Then the order gets stopped in billing due to the same missing documentation. I'm always informed that they will update the file and they don't follow through. Numerous times I've called my insurance company to talk to edgepark with me on the line and supposedly is fixed. On the 1st I call in and low and behold they need the medical necessity. I seem to get the run around. They continually put my order on a hold I'm constantly having to tell them I'm on his last can and by the time I recieve the shipment my 6 month old infant out down to his last few bottles. Why?  How can a company be so incompetent that they cannot update the information on file that they already have in the system?  Why do I have to fight with them every single month?  This past month I called on the 27th to place the order. Customer service supposedly sends the order 4 days pass no package I called back they said I never placed an order. I get switched from one person to another they finally fess up that the order was rotated through 4 customer service reps and then canceled. Why wasn't I informed?  No phone call no email nothing to inform me of the issue. I call on the 1st it's another 2 hour phone call of they need this info they need that it's being held up my coding now it's being held up by billing. Finally the issue is resolved they are sending out formula I recieve an email and surprise I'm only getting half my order. Why?  Today is another merry go round I've talked to probably 10+ reps nobody has an answer and the issue still isn't resolved. Save yourself the stress and go with a different company. Edgepark doesn't care about their customers who depend on them to provide services that they bill insurance for. They show no compassion and no initiative to resolve issues as they arise. This company will do nothing more than frustrate you with every conversation. They are incompetent when it comes to doing their part and point the finger at your insurance company and you as the customer.,1,LROs3-k8n9zPQmI8amTR1A

"In the three months since my last review, the Hibachi Grill continuies to maintain its' high standard of great food, fresh and fast. They are so incredibly friendly, and I am glad that this hasn't changed. (Also, we had some broccoli in our Hibachi meals this time, and it was a really inspired addition! I hope that they keep it up.)

We tried a few new things today. My son said that his order of Spicy chicken was excellent. My husband really enjoyed his scallops, which were nicely browned and seared but still moist and juicy on the inside. The Lobster and Shrimp combo (my order) did not disappoint either. The lobster was sweet and nicely seared (not the usual treatment that Canadians use for lobster, so be prepared - I loved it). The shrimp was as great as ever.  To my taste, Hibachi's signature yum yum sauce is best suited to meats, and their homemade spicy sauce pairs well with seafood.  

How do they achieve that beautifully seared, flavourful exterior without turning the seafood to rubber? I sure can't do it at home, which makes Hibachi Grill the perfect take-out for a busy night. 

Next time, I want to try the unagi.",5,cS1dCEpjrDYjrP6g6W3m2Q
"Bait and switch.  That's the best way to describe these guys.  I was quoted a fixed price for moving things so when they came and worked slowly, I mean it is pretty obvious they were dragging their feet.  I've hired many movers in my life and in my 20 years of hiring movers, I've never seen anyone move this slow.  Not only did they move slow, they decided to wrap my furniture 10 times and did it at a snail's pace.  I didn't complain at first because I was quoted a fix price.

When they finished, they actually said it was by the hour and $144.00/hr at that for 3 guys.  This was the first time I heard of that.  The whole job on day 1 took 9 hours including driving time.  However they charged me an extra hour for driving, even though 9 hours already included driving time.  They said this is their standard practice (of bilking customers).

If I had known, I would have hired much cheaper and honest movers.  Total cost for a local move, $2,900.  They quoted about $1,300.  They even had the nerve to ask me for a review.  So here it is.  They even asked for a tip saying that most people are too cheap to give them one.  I could have hired guys in front of home depot for $500.",1,Thz-HXnEmqzcSTOHeid5wA

"My family and I visited 520 BBQ House twice; once for snack, another time for all you can eat ($19.99 regular, $16.99 on Tuesday).

Skewers ranges from $2.99 - $6.99. Most items have the same flavour; salt, chili pepper, and cumin. Every item started tasting the same after the first two or three skewers. It masks the natural flavours of the ingredients. 

Similar to other reviewers, my favorite is the Enokitake mushroom skewer and Korean Cabbage. My family did not enjoy any of the meat skewers. They felt lamb skewers lacked the gamey flavour of lamb, beef skewers lacked the earthy flavour of beef. Lastly, chicken gizzard and squid tentacles skewers were very tough. As well, my father felt they used a natural gas grill instead of a traditional charcoal grill. 

Overall, 520 BBQ ranges from a 2 to 2.5 stars (rounded to 3 stars for this review), depending on the day.",3,eb8XRyIokVgKxvtCtL4Zdg
"I had heard good things about the 'dog, and have to say that in general, I was a bit disappointed.

We happened to be in the area for one reason or another, and so we stopped in for what we hoped would be a quick meal. The menu looked appetizing, and after placing our order, we settled into a nice discussion and waited for things to arrive. And waited. And waited. And waited.

Eventually the dishes showed up, which meant we were able to dig into our dishes, and it just led to some disappointment. To be fair, it could have been because of the huge wait. But the dishes really didn't live up to the description on the menu, or to the level we  had been hoping for that was seen by many other reviews. They weren't bad - they just didn't have the kick we were expecting.

Off night? Perhaps - it happens to everyone. We may try again, but since they aren't in our neck of the woods, it might be a while.

On the upside, the decor was definitely interesting, and because of the service misses, we had plenty of time to look at it.",2,lSpQGob-ceMRQvKBadkdZQ

The bathroom was outdated with a clogged shower and toilet which required repair from the maintenance crew who looked pretty scary. The air conditioning unit was super loud, loud enough where you could not sleep with it on making it pretty stuffy. Patio area outside was a nice touch but the patio chairs and table were filthy. The only good thing about this ""resort"" was the pool and hot tub. Definately not worth the $18 per day resort fee. Would not recommend this property",1,fLMmFmq0Pf43DnLnfW6VXg
"Wow, this was genuinely terrible food. I ordered through Uber Eats as my boys have been going through a noodle phase and love everything noodles. I ordered the following as I thought they were pretty safe choices.
- Yaki Udon. Very salty with uneven cuts of veggies of which some were partially cooked and came sopping in a ""soup"" of sauce that filled a quarter of the container. Let me tell you, there is nothing worse than stir fried noodles where the noodles are drippy in pure soya sauce.
- Steak Teriyaki. Similar where the meat was very tough, the rice came overcooked and soggy and sopping in sauce and again, most of the veggies were unevenly chopped and were still raw.

Most of the food ended up being inedible - what a shame!",1,wSI7X7qqMfDQxkNFHkOYwA
"Let me begin by saying that I wrote an email to the owners of the Flying Fig on December 1, 2013, and have yet to receive a response. It has been two whole months since then -- callous and unacceptable. The owners obviously do not care.

This was my message:
""Had brunch at the Fig on Sunday. Ordered a Bloody Mary and an orange cocktail (acceptable). Also ordered Biscuits & Gravy (good) and Migas (okay). But what killed our experience was the HORRENDOUS service.  

Our server, Josh, was distracted and did not check on us.  When he did come he did not demonstrate knowledge of the menu.  I asked which he would recommend, between the omelette and Migas.  He ummed, ahhed, and failed to provide a coherent response. When the food came he did not see if the items were to our liking. When we asked for the check he delivered it and then failed to come back for our credit card in a timely manner. He walked by our table several times before I flagged him down in desperation. Instead of apologizing he feigned surprise. Terrible.

Suffice it to say the service we experienced at your restaurant left much to be desired. I hope that you will take these comments under advisement.""",1,7oBRobbAS-TXo5slA2J5xw
"High expectations based on the reviews, as I love divey burrito spots. 
 Unfortunately, expectations were not met.  I had the breakfast burrito with machaca.  Three basic issues.  First, the burrito was bland.  Not much flavor at all.  Second, the salsas are disappointing - super watery and very little flavor.  You can't have a great burrito without great salsa.  One point deduction for the salsa fail.  Finally, there was too much tortilla, not enough filling.  I get they want to keep the price low, and that's fine, but don't use such a big tortilla if you're not going to fill it.  Another point deducted for the underfilled tortilla.  Overall, not worth the longish drive out from Paradise Valley.",2,OPt2UUaXRcQOA4iGEz5Ffg

"very nice, room was beautiful as was the bathroom. Very quiet as well, slept like a baby. Staff left something to be desired, as we checked in late for one night after an event near by at nearly 10:30. Girl at the front did not end her conversation to greet us until we were right in front of her waiting. We were not specified a check out time, and housekeeping woke us up at 7:30 then again knocked at 11:30 to ask ""when we'd be leaving."" Other wise a pleasant experience.",3,ysCYpVNkslHXvfwZnEzsBQ

"Avoid this place. They do not care about customer service, nor do they back the products they sell. I bought my girlfriend a over priced vape stick for her birthday here.. and of course when I gave it to her, she didn't like it. After taking it back to the store still sealed in box, with receipt 6 days after purchase, the minimum wage queen who was working the register denied the refund, opened the sealed box because she couldn't understand why it was being returned... after telling this person 10 times its BRAND NEW, NEVER USED she still kept asking is there juice in the unit.. she still denied the return. Bottom line, I don't have time to deal with places like this due to shady stuff, so I simply take my money elsewhere.  After some research I found out this particular unit was $30 bucks more expensive than anywhere else.. so I caution each and every one of you to price check this place.  Ripoff, Horrible Customer service, and bad attitudes. Now I buy my coils, juice and other vape stuff somewhere else. They do not deserve my business, or yours. You have been warned.",1,xYyLMOXwAkgPtLoob12SDw
"Can a single meal completely change your perception of fine dining?

Can a single meal radically alter your relationship with food in general?

I think it can -- and Sage proves it.  After my dinner here, I'll never look at food quite the same way again.  To say it was my favorite meal in Las Vegas would be an understatement.  It would be more accurate to say it was one of my top meals of *all time*.

It began with an 8pm reservation for two.  Sage, located in the Aria hotel, has a relatively unassuming entrance, but that belies that grandeur to be found inside.  The restaurant is immense, with high ceilings, sumptuous furnishings, and a gorgeous color scheme with lots of golds accents and stunning chandeliers.  Needless to say, Sage is just as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the taste buds. 

After we were seated, our incredibly friendly and kind server, John, came by with the breadbasket.  We each had the sourdough roll and a bacon brioche -- and both were excellent.  They were served with sea salt (served on a tablespoon) and whipped butter. 

Deciding what to order was easy as pie -- we both had the 4-course tasting menu ($79).  My dinner companion splurged on the wine pairing ($39).  Our server's wine pours were *very* generous -- a lot more than the advertised half glass per course .  In fact, I was able to enjoy some wine with every course without bothering to order the wine pairing myself. 

Below is a run-down of everything that we ate.  Absolutely everything was cooked and presented with the utmost class and sophistication.  The refinement of this dinner was unlike anything I'd previously experienced.

**AMUSE BOUCHE ... PRE-DINNER**
A shot glass of gazpacho.  Fresh and tangy.  A wonderful starter.

**COURSE #1**
Wagyu beef tartare with buttered crostini.  Easily the finest tartare I've ever had.  The beef was unctuous and fresh; the egg only added to the indulgence.  Chocolate shavings provided an unexpected layer of complexity.

**COURSE #2**
Seared Maine dayboat scallops with broccolini, braised oxtail, mushrooms, and caramel reduction.  The scallops were cooked beautifully and fall apart when touched with a fork.  The broccolini was tender.  The caramel sauce provided an intriguing sweetness that contrasted against the saltiness of the shellfish.

**COURSE #3**
48 hour beef belly with braised apples.  I've never had beef this tender and succulent in my life.  Each bite dissolves on your palate and overwhelms you with flavor.  Apples provide a gentle acidity that works well against the umami of the beef.

**COURSE #4**
Pistachio tart with strawberry ice cream.  A culinary work of art -- oodles of individual components meticulously arranged.  Bold, fresh flavors all over the plate.  An enjoyable juxtaposition of hot and cold. 

**AMUSE BOUCHE ... POST-DINNER**
Hot white chocolate with mint and coconut, served in a white porcelain shot glass.  A sweet, uplifting treat at the end of a fantastic meal.

After this meal, I wasn't just full and satisfied -- I was exhilarated, knowing that I had a world-class gastronomic experience.  The staff at Sage earned every penny of their tip.

This isn't the sort of meal I can have everyday -- but it's worth doing once in a while, if for no other reason to remind yourself that fine dining can truly be life-changing.

If you subscribe to the ""you only live once"" philosophy, than a dinner at Sage is a must.",5,j8TqiFpIZJjCsm4cvMHTzQ
"I bought a new bike here about 2.5 years ago and went in for a tune-up the other weekend and was reminded of how wonderful my initial purchase experience was. 

I didn't have a bike growing up, so learning to ride a bike as an adult was terrifying, and buying the right bike was really important. The staff took their time with me, showing me lots of options, and helping me take them out on the sidewalk to test. They were patient and kind. 

My bike has been amazing, great quality, perfect for my needs. I had shopped around a lot (I had gone to about 12 different shops and stores) when I was looking for my first bike, and the bike prices here were really outstanding. 

When I went back in to get it tuned up, they got it done in just 15 minutes - I am not sure this can always be done so quickly, but certainly I was impressed and very pleased. 

I noticed one negative review about the prices for accessories - I have to agree that accessories seemed a bit pricey here, and have bought my lights, helmet, etc. from MEC which has very reasonable prices. 

When it comes to buying a new or used bike, and getting it serviced, I can't recommend this place enough.",5,DijB4ojtbs_kuH5KbU07Nw
"Always do the V.I.P. Shuttle for $28 round trip when I don't rent a car. They say you may share but only once has this happened on the trip from the airport to the hotel. Never on the return trip to the airport. Driver always offers to stop by the liquor store on the way to the hotel. Always punctual on the return trip, getting you there when plenty of time to spare. Just don't forget to call 24 hours before to confirm. They send an email when the driver is on his way. Great service for the price.",5,Z813DrwKwwMff8HHkKNcXA
"This is the cutest place ever in life. When you walk in you can tell that they handle everything with attention to detail, not just the decor.  

The food!!! He gave us an extra piece of fish, even though we only ordered the one piece. Yay!! The fish is thick and chunky... They take their fish and chips real serious here. Customer service is top notch. He really made sure we had everything we needed.

We'll be back!! Lol just like the name says, it's off the hook!",5,dQoAD81EIpNQpuikPJOTjA
"This place gave me that good feeling of the small business.  The employees seemed to actually care and put pride in their job.  One of the cooks came outside and asked my family how the food was a+ dude!!  As for the food.. I god a basket which included chili cheese fries, chicken tenders, and spicy chicken tenders... all of which were awesome.  Portion size was beyond reasonable for the cost but this was all offset by the fact that the food was good and fresh and made by someone who put pride in his job. I wish I could remember his name, I was suprised when I asked if he was the owner and he said he was just a cook and that he cared about making quality food for the guests,  THAT MAN DESERVES A RAISE! A++ highly recommended will go back and bring guests.

**update 5/13

Went back excited to have the wonderful chicken...
The blonde Amazon woman at the register should at least make an attempt to be more service oriented. Looking away while I was ordering, I didn't even know if she was listening to me. Questions about the food were answered but it seemed like they were an inconvenience for her to answer.  On the flip side the 2 men that were working were super friendly, hats off to them.  As for the food... I'll have to go back to confirm but it did not taste like I remembered, it really wasn't as good as I remember. I will go back for another try and update.  Peace out yelpers!",4,xF210Hnfah4n3eBUfMnNQQ
"So I had a consultation to get my lips to a luscious shape that I have always wanted. My appointment was May 23. It was supposed to be May 22 but the doctors offices called and asked if I could switch it to the 23 which was no problem. I was greeted by a very nice, sweet, professional lady (I am so sorry I forgot your name) she handed me my paperwork and said if I had questions don't hesitate to ask. I waited about 5 minutes and I was greeted by Blanca (I only remember her cause I have her card). She took me back to an examination room and asked what brings me to them. I told her I wanted nice big lips but not fake. She said she knew exactly what I met. She said your lips are definitely small and could use a little something lol. She had me at that answer. Honestly is the best policy! We went through two different fillers I could use and the prices. She handed me what she quoted me on and I am set up to have my lips done June 26th! She showed me two ladies that worked in the office(I am so so sorry I forgot your names) that had there lips done and they were gorgeous. I have read the reviews on here and it scares me a little but personally I had a great experience. I also did my research:)",5,m3Ef2B6MkhE49ChzdPbBQQ
"Okay, honestly, Honey Bear's couldn't hang in Memphis, Birmingham, Houston, or Lockhart  ... and fortunately for them, they don't need to 'hang' because they are smoking their meats in the BBQ wasteland of Phoenix, AZ.  

Because I fancy myself a BBQ expert (note: I'm more of a brisket purist), its difficult to rate HB's based on the integrity of the THEIR OWN meat and not as a comparison to others Valley and Nation-wide. This is exactly 'why' I think many of their rating suffer because everyone has undoubtedly had better BBQ elsewhere, wherever you may hail from, and it takes a stringent push from one's own natural reflexes to resist matching HBs up to 'local awesome BBQ joint'.  BBQ connoisseurs are funny like that.

So, overall, HB's earns a 3-star based on the following:

Pork Ribs - I'm more of a beef rib expert, but these ribs were generous and plentiful in their combo plate.  I was surprised that there was very likely a whole half-rack on my plate.  They are very tasty even without the sauce, with a nice peppery rub that did not dry out the meat.

Smoked Chicken - Juicy but slightly greasy.  This is amongst the most difficult smoked meat to pull off due to the propensity for it to become a stringy, dehydrated mess.  I don't think I would order it again, but the flavor was pretty decent and I don't regret trying it.

Pulled Pork - I got a 1/2 lb of pulled pork as a side meat, along with a couple of extra buns to make as a half-sandwich (a glob of meat on a half bun, folded over like a taco).  This is the only time I typically use sauce to counterbalance the white bread, whether its pork, brisket, or sausage.  I was surprised by how dry the pork was, particularly because pork is fatty and juicy, but here at HB's it was extra lean.  I thought I would hate the pork bc of this fact, but the sauce saves it from being a choking bolus of pig and flour.  Now I understand why they typically put this on a full bun and drown it in sauce.  As the 'specialty' of this restaurant, its kind of a gaffe that the quality is poor, but as a consumer, I'd order it again in limited amounts, and only as a 'side'.  Why?  Because I can provide my own perfect ratio of bread:pork:sauce.  Otherwise, I don't think that HB's could build me a pulled pork sandwich I could be happy with.

Sauce - If you don't know any better you'd think it was tip-top.  Sure, its 'pretty good', but its most-definitely a one-note mixture.  Too sweet for their peppery rubs.  A spicier sauce would do the trick better, IMO.

Corn on the Cob - Serviceable, but soggy and strangely devoid of spices typical of southern cuisine.

Cowbro Beans - Awesome.  Smokey flavor, thick sauce, and chunks of their smoked sausage.  Great compliment to a BBQ dinner.

Soda Fountain - The city's best.  BBQ restaurant staples such as 1a) Dr Pepper 1b) Big Red.  Their 'cola' is RC and they have Hines Rootbeer, Sunkist, Country Time Lemonade, and 7-Up.  They did some solid research on the fluid necessities of BBQ palates.  They also have a fridge of beer.

Price -  All that, which I described above came out to $33 with a large tip because the guy behind the counter was very cool.  It fed two hungry people during the season finale of LOST, with plenty extra for leftovers.  Very pleased in this area.

Overall - Hey, its PHX, and here we are better adapted to 'fill-ins' for our favorite spots back home.  It happens in every culinary category, from philly cheesesteaks to fish n chips; gnocchi to Q.  Why should this place be any different?",3,gU2x1aj93Fc6qua7HZZLZA
"3 with an .5 for service...maybe it was just our server or maybe that's the standard. But she was super attentive and helpful. However she forgot our water but other than that deserved every penny

I ordered an L.A Mac and cheese. It came in a skillet which was pretty cute...although with that price tag I should have got to keep the skillet $14 dollars for such a small portion... I'm a broke uni student so I'm just thinking how many McDoubles can I buy with that. Other than that the Mac & cheese was creamy gooey and artery clogging.

Sweet potato fries were pretty standard. Sorbet was good but could be made at home. 

Solid alternative to non-Asian food in Markham that's not a Boston pizza or Kelsey's",3,Z4MoTc5BtNIPOWBYLq0B9w

"I went to DW Bistro with my lunch group (a bunch of foodies who like to eat and try new places). We go to a different restaurant weekly to find ""good and the bad"" in this town. This was a good experience. The service was excellent. Our group conversed with several different waiters asking questions about the decor and food. Everyone was gracious and fun to talk to. We had reservations and came early to find they had our table ready. Unfortunately a few of our group did not show. Those who came loved the food. I only gave this a 4 because my salad was not the best. The tuna was excellent but it had too many salty items on the plate (lots of beans, olives, and a few other bland vegetables). The salad dressing was excellent. Other plates (salmon bowl, veggie burger, special bowl, sandwiches)  looked delicious. Everyone was happy and they even gave us our required separate checks with a smile. We will go here again. I want to try the dessert menu next time. The carrot cake looked amazing.",4,dN4T6drof7oe0k6PwgdGYw
"Think this is a better priced hotel when you peruse online travel sites - BEWARE! Monte Carlo charges the daily resort fee of $30.00 + $3.67 tax when you checkout.

"I have never eaten at D'Vine, so this review is just about their wine - specifically their flights!

Oh jeez, their flights. This is probably the best value for wine downtown. They currently have 16 4-wine flights to choose from, all between $15-$18. These aren't little sips of wine - these are half-filled (or more) glasses. I have never left here without a significant (or very significant) buzz.

When it's warm enough, I love that they have outdoor seating. I've never had any issues with the service here, and would gladly come back for (yet another) flight of wine!",5,o6N4MQsmwU9emac2lH_3pA
"Bottom line: I did not hire them. Keep reading for entertainment value. 
I requested quotes from several businesses to clean a large sofa and 2 carpets. Spoke to Cheryl at Sir Carpet, who told me the starting prices and said a tech would come the next day to give me the exact price and then do the job. ""Damon"" (I doubt that's his real name), came in all friendly and began explaining the job. Then he got to the money. He went into infomercial mode, talking a mile a minute and telling me the base prices Cheryl gave me were wrong. A $240 job was suddenly $350. My husband told him we're not hiring him and he left. Bonus #1: He said he's the owner and boss and Cheryl is his wife. Then he told me he has a girlfriend, who is in a coma in Australia but he's texting her every day. Bonus #2: He threw trash on my driveway. Bonus #3: Cheryl called to apologize and offered to send a different tech. I asked if Damon was the owner and she said no! I said I'm not doing business with her company and hung up. I hope he's not really her husband either.",1,JTUWdqcbEQcDSYUQsJ-rYg

My friend went with a 1/2 order of pancakes - this was more like a crepe, but tasty as hell.

1) I suggest you try the phosphates (old fashioned soda pop), 2) they reportedly have good hangover treatment burgers, 3) their salad bar is pretty darn good, 4) you should sit in the front, not the back, and 5) if both price and ambiance is important to you, this is one of the best places to eat in Urbana, especially for breakfast.

"I have a favorite cuisine and everyone who knows me knows I love Thai food. My husband has been trying to take me to Nittaya's for over a year now, we finally made it there last weekend and all I could think of was the many dinners I've missed out on and how I'm going to make it up. We started with the Chicken dumpling/puffs ?  I forget the menu name, it was reminiscent of basil chicken stuffed in pastry dough. Volcano Shrimp and the Spinach Salad. The Spinach lives up to the hype people don't mess up your opportunity to order this delicious item. For our entrees we had the Pad Thai and the seafood coconut curry. I'm about to say something crazy but this was the best Pad Thai I have ever had ! Hands down it's amazing. The seafood coconut curry has an egg cracked inside of it which changes the texture from a smooth curry to one with a little chew. I thought it was delicious but we agreed we would probably order something different next time.

We also had the chicken dish since it was the very item that won Chef Lee, Top Chef. It was excellent! Also don't miss the Sangria. Refreshing, 25 ingredients including a tropical fruit cocktail that is left to enjoy in your glass. Service was exceptional and patio was a great atmosphere.

"I wish I could give more stars because the management is super friendly and accommodating and the place is very clean and well taken care of. Unfortunately, I will not return because I had a very uncomfortable experience last weekend with a nail technician blaming me for a schedule mixup and raising her voice at me in front of other customers as she is doing my manicure. For 9 months I had always, always scheduled with the same two technicians.. one does my mani and the other my pedi simultaneously. I scheduled with both, signed in and indicated both their names and I also told the front desk that I am scheduled with both ladies. I was called back by the lady who does my pedicures and she stared my manicure instead. I was confused but I assumed the front desk arranged this because my manicure lady had just starts applying polish a few seats away on another customer. I had no problem with that and was willing to stay a little longer because I knew it was worth having the lady do both. Front desk came by and apologized for not telling the technician that I had scheduled with both and that it would take longer. I had no problem because mix ups happen and it was the first mishap anyway. As the lady is doing my pedicure she asked why I didn't notify her that someone else is doing my manicure. This caught me off guard and told her I thought it's what the front desk arranged. She raised her voice said no and that it was my job to tell her this info. I advised that it was a misunderstanding and again she raised her voice and said ""next time, you have to tell me"" in a very rude tone and I had about 4-5 technicians along with their customers staring at me. I finally snapped back raising my voice and told her to stop raising her voice at me because i don't work there and it isn't my responsibility to arrange it and she can discuss it with the front desk. I felt SO uncomfortable. I only go to her because her work is so clean regardless of the fact that in the last 9 months she can't even manage to look me in the face and say hi. She decided to be nice after and call me ""sweetie"" and ""love"" when time came to pay. I won't put up with that fakeness and rude attitude. I'd rather she not talk to me at all and just fix my nails rather than talk to me as if I owe her something. Owners weren't there so I'm leaving this review because this info probably never got to them even after I called and complained. Oh and the techs were arguing over who was going to do my pedi. She was forced to do it and wasn't happy about it. Please get your nail techs in check and fix their attitudes. All I wanted was a quiet nail session and instead I walked out embarrassed.",1,3UkVir-uj-5F-wcus5ITvg
don't buy the guardsman protection plan it doesn't cover anything! Biggest waste of money!! They tell you it will cover anything and it doesn't! Also the Beckham couch doesn't hold up it pills terrible from just sitting on it not very often!! And it was too expensive to be ruined after a year and a half! DONT BUY!!!,1,b323YtgekfI6Mc-AxS2vFw
"My family and I rented a 14 yard bin to clean out multiple rooms in our house. We ended up filling it up pretty high, but we had over 25 tubs of computer parts, college things from the 80's, and more obsolete things that were taking up a lot of space. This company was extremely helpful, quick, reliable, customer-service oriented, timely, and friendly. They allowed us to have the bin for as long as we wanted, and told us they ""don't recognize holidays, and would come at any time."" With this being right at Christmas time (literally we emailed them in the evening on the 21st and were able to get a bin the 22nd in the early morning) we were astounded with how great they were. The man who dropped off the bin told us that he was more than happy to do this, and had even cracked 4 ribs the day before! Talk about high quality people! The man who was picking up our bin even picked up stray pieces of trash that was on our driveway. The bin doesn't even touch the driveway! How amazing is that? They load it on wood so that it doesn't cause any driveway damage and will sweep your driveway afterwards! We are SO impressed with the quality of service we received, and intend on using them again when we go through our garage. Thanks for giving us part of our house back!",5,3RMa9bg1QFDIfUsWA2Y6nA
"Heard nothing but great things about this place. Definitely needed to stop by and see what the rave is about..Simple concept almost like a snack shack/ soda shop. Fiiz drinks has so much variety!! Delicious snacks & drinks. Great establishment. It is kept tidy & presentable. Plenty of sitting room, they also have bar stool chairs which i thought that was pretty cool. The staff is so welcoming, helpful & patient when it came to ordering. Also, if you do not like your drink they will change it, free of charge! I can't wait to come back to try more flavors off their menu or maybe even customize my own!",5,BHv-ggrWROBaSVkqVV6xBA
"Second time at Gordan Biersch, first at this location.  I like this place.  The food and value is good for what you get.  My favorite menu items are the small plates.  I'll get 2 or 3 depending on how hungry I am.  Last night I enjoyed the Gorgonzola Prosciutto Chips which were very tasty, even if I am 99% sure it was just ham and not prosciutto (lol).  The Gorgonzola sauce is the bomb.  I seriously wanted to lick my plate.
Their beers are good and I am not a beer drinker at all.  My husband ordered their new pumpkin spice brew and I kept stealing sips, it was so delicious!
This location has fantastic atmosphere, being in the middle of the hopping section of Mill Ave.  That being said, parking is horrific on a Friday night.  Our service was really fantastic. 
All in all, a great place and we'll definitely return.",4,ng7T_opoFwApSKfr7zp3UQ
"Heard about this interesting steak house from Lindsay, my Yelping 'go to' and I am grateful. What a fun night, feeling ""Mad Men' ish as we walked through the kitchen when entering the restuarant. 

Atmosphere was amazing and the food.... WOW. My fav had to be the amazing steak and bean chili/soup.... fantastic.

Steaks were our of this world and the mushrooms... devine.

When entering the restaurant we greeted by helpful eager staff ... with each one adding input into our experience.... especially Patti, our server. She was helpful, informative, fun and sealed the deal of a fantastic night. Thanks",5,G_gMFbgtKUjF0jIDeo9Oog
"Perfect restaurant to bring visitors to the Old Port of Montreal for work dinner. The ambiance is great, stone walls, beautiful ceilings and operating fire place on each floor. If the municipality of Montreal could fix the side street our guests would be even more impressed, but of course that has nothing to do with the food quality.

The restaurant is advertising itself as a steak house and they are proud of their Canadian beef, as such they really know how to make a good steak. Very happy with my centre cut fillet mignon, prepared exactly medium rare as requested, very slightly burned from outside as I like it. Besides the steaks some of my companions also enjoyed their black cod. We wanted to share with our guests the pride of the Montreal cuisine, the roast beef poutine. The poutine was a little bit disappointing, fries were kind of cold and the roast beef presence was minimal. I guess we shocked the chef with that order. 

The service is great. I started the night with classic dry martini, so good. The cocktail list needs to be explored by me again. With that said I would come some other time for a personal dinner and when in need of a good steak.",4,3gxFWbrXcmBZBQTEbaXdbg
"This guys Gerarado (Owner) is a total asshole. Dropped the car at 7:30am first thing ""says it'll take an hour"". Three hours later I callback ""it'll be another hour"". Three additional hours later ""your car was ready at 2pm I told you that, you won't let me talk"" he says. Show up and wouldn't you know it his tech tells me it's still not done. It's now 4:00pm I'm sitting in the parking lot with no car and a day ruined. Stereotypical New Yorker

"We had just flown in and were STARVING. Our cute waitress kept the food coming until we were too full for dessert. 

Loved their spinach flour chips with custom guacamole. Everything was flavorful and delicious--calamari, coconut shrimp, mole' cheese enchiladas, shrimp fajitas, baked avocados with cherry tomatoes and shrimp, tacos stuffed with yummy ground beef, etc.",5,nhPPwEIKV1mkzRRqpsPo2A
"Solid OK.

Music: They seem to play whatever's popular, nothing niche or anything like that.

Dance floor: It's a long narrow rectangle in the middle of the main floor, so we prepared for a highway down the middle of people walking from one end to the other. Upstairs is small and usually has a private party going on, but when it doesn't it plays a different style of music (depending on who's DJ'ing sometimes it's better/worse than downstairs).

Clientele: Kind of a bit on the douchy side, but there's a mixed variety here, and it really depends on the night (if there's a special event going on for example).

Patio: I've gotta admit their patio is amazing.  It was decent before, but they've renovated and now it's just massive.  It's big enough i can go out there to relax and get a break from the dance floor; even as a non-smoker i barely notice that everyone is smoking. If i was only rating their patio they'd get 5/5.

Dress code: you can get in with pretty much anything if you're not too drunk, judging by all the graphic tee's.  They sometimes restrict sneakers (if they're busy) but mostly they don't care if you can afford the $20 cover.  If you're in a blazer you'll be the best dressed person in there.

Bottle service: the one time we got bottle service here we had a blast until we went to go dance.  We left our half-finished bottle with the bartender, and when we returned to claim it they told us it had been finished when we dropped it off. With a group of drunk guys i suppose it's possible, but we all agreed that there was definitely SOMETHING left in our bottle when we dropped it off.",3,EP6vuOLvU0qizwxpZS8EuQ
"Went here for lunch....sat at the bar with my husband and ordered sushi for me and Hawaiian breakfast for him.  From a very rude service,  we felt unwelcome and almost as if we were bothering the waitress, to very very chewy seaweed,  (low quality ingredients and supplies) and semi-dirty place.

"Next to the one in Shadyside, this is my favorite Fine Wine & Good Spirits store.

"UPDATE: This is now insanely busy what with exams happening every single week of every month. But I just want to add THEIR SANDWICHES ARE DELICIOUS!! The grilled chicken is freaking amazing! The filling they use is so good! And curry chicken is unexpectedly delicious too!

I FOUND MY HEAVEN. I loooooooooooove cafes where I can sit and enjoy their goodies in peace. I don't like visiting a beautiful coffee shop and feel like people are rushing me. Because I can make my own good coffee at home, you know? Why would I bother coming to a coffee shop if I can't stay?

Mamie Clafoutis makes incredible pistachio croissants and almond croissants, as well as cookies and tonssssss of bread. PLUS they have lots and lots and lots of comfortable seating upstairs. The tables are big enough for a computer and a Wacom tablet, messy papers and pencils, textbooks, and my food and coffee. This is bigger than my desk at home! Also lots of OUTLETS!! LOTS OF POWER!!!!!!!!!! 

I originally wanted to do a Sherbrook station bakery hop, but I visited Mamie Clafoutis first and never left. It's so comfortable here that I called my friend, and we both studied here. The table is big enough for both our stuff.

This is, in fact, my heaven. Washrooms are clean. Wifi is not super fast when more people are here, but it is faster than Starbucks and 100% working. Staff is absolutely wonderful. The smell of the bakery is delightful, so feel free to watch the kitchen from upstairs!

The pistachio croissant plus cafe au lait is about $8. But this isn't the typical airy and tiny croissant. The croissant is quite filling and heavy! I looooooved mine. The almond is good too!",5,5bubrg7K_yNx6Ml7Mv5XcQ

"Believe the hype! If you like classic donuts that happen to be vegan, this is the place. We had a sampling, and they were all delicious.The chocolate cream filled was the best I've ever had.

If you're from out of town and you don't want to pay to have someone drive you there, the bus stops right at the shop! Take the Deuce Strip bus to the Wynn and then get on the 203 (the stop is right at the Fashion Show Complex).",5,3CtxvD7JKLDdbRjUEQJ_qQ
"What a great place to take a break from the crowds of the strip! You can duck away into the basement and enjoy some quality Mexican food (and fantastic margaritas) while escaping the masses. We had a large group of thirsty bikers but still had a hard time finishing our pitchers - they are huge! In the end, of course, we prevailed, but it was a challenge! The food is also very good. Being a big taco fan, I ordered the Mini Tacos, forgoing the rice and beans so I could try both the Shrimp and the Steak. They were great! I also tried a bite of the Lengua out of curiosity. I wasn't a fan but I think that I am just not a fan of cow tongue.",4,iLljKCGmS05EDhKE-SFN8w

"Its killing me to write this review because i really enjoy myself when i come to the salon. ive gone to a few different ladies there and they are all sweet and very pleasant. However this past month i have gone 2 times for a full set of acrylics and both times with the same tech the nails seem to pop off within the week. at first i thought i was being really rough with my nails thats why they were popping off but when it happened twice i was really disappointed.  i even had to cancel my fill appointment because nails kept popping off.. when i called the salon to the tell the receptionist about cancelling my appointment due to the nails popping off the only advice she could give me was that the tech has a slot open after my appointment to replace the nail. thats not the answer i was looking for.. i just got the nails why do i need to replace them so quickly. 

im really angry at all of this because nails are not cheap and everytime i go i spend $50-$60 and i still tip..",2,zVPzpDrlbGQG_gV3veIvOg

"Came to the Flamingo for 4 nights for my birthday. I booked it through hotels.com and booked a strip view room. Upon getting there, they gave me a room with the Ferris wheel view, and would not accommodate what I had originally purchased. They stated those rooms were full. 

Pros- The location of the strip is great, its in the heart of the strip, with 4 star hotels and casinos near by. Its also near a lot of restaurants and a couple clubs. The outdoor lighting of the flamingo gives it a lot of spunk. 

Cons- The room I had was pretty dark, but the overall cleanliness wasn't something to go home talking about. You get what you pay for here. I wish there was a way I could've got my money back for a night, due to the TV not working. I asked the front desk and nobody ever showed up and they did not change my room. The room was ""non smoking"" but smelled like the previous guests had smoked in there. There were cob webs on the window. 
The shower pressure was very low and there was a roach on the floor. I wish I had taken pictures but we spent most of the time outside of the room. 
 They also didn't mention the resort fee until we got there, what if we weren't prepared for that? Next time I come here, I highly doubt ill be staying at the Flamingo again.",2,s7qzZqzPUL2GAqRhIqoJCA

The security came running, and they had in house paramedics come and also the manager.  Everyone was very helpful and they called Henderson paramedics.  The waitress came up and said she was sorry and hoped all would be better. Overall I was so impressed we with their efficiency and helpfulness.We definitely want to go back and have dinner soon.",5,6jGavQHXbr-4kKVWu-HXig

"I took my 10 year old niece to get our finger and toenails painted as a reward for her completion of school.  I made an appointment in advance.  I let them know that we would come in with clean nails ready to be painted, that we didn't want clippers, files, etc.  Just your basic polish and go.  
When we arrived, the receptionist took us back to a manicurist station and painted my niece's nails in about 4 minutes, and then grabbed her feet from under the table and painted them.  I asked if she would let my niece move to the pedicure chair so she could have the ""experience"" of getting a massage and having her toes painted, i.e. to feel like a big girl.  She flat out told me ""no.""  I'm not confrontational or anything, but I did question why not since we: a) made an appointment; and b) there were 5-6 open chairs.  She just told me that other appointments were scheduled.  
Then, another lady arrived to paint my nails.  She painted mine in record speed.  I never understand how someone can manage to paint all over your skin but miss the edges of your nails at the same time.  Must be purposeful?  Not sure.  I took the polish off myself when I went home.
Anyway, the customer service was bad, the work was bad, and it was just a bad experience all together.  Also, the salon is super tiny and cramped and not fancy at all.  Basically, huge letdown.",1,Kdtmu775pdb3kWKwZDtlLQ

Perfect for people partying at Cosmo and need a bite afterwards or if you're just exploring in the center strip during daytime and need a lunch break.",5,sBq3ubFJzuM9KRhlZxHBjA
Do they ever have fully working pumps? At all times they have at least 2-3 pumps that are out of service when I come here.

Taco salad, beef, stroganoff, crab cake, lamb shank, meatball, and various pastas.Overall, it tasted great (though I wouldn't order the meatball again).

"This sleek little Italian place (formerly LV Grill) left my mouth watering taste buds a-tinglin'. All the ingredients are super fresh and many are imported from Italy. The pizzas are amazing: thin crust, excellent toppings. I had the pizza with Buffalo Mozzarella from Italy, which was generously topped on the pizza along w/ some good sauce and cherry tomatoes. Olives and cheese were delicious as well. The waiter (also owner?) seemed like he was from Italy, a good sign. I'm going back for some panini.

update: went back for some panini, which was sub-par, dropping my rating to 4 stars. this place is always empty, which is kind of a drag, but the buffala di mozzarella pizza is the shoopsie, my noopsie.",4,ejb3jJUhem-y3QAPJsr4_Q

"Well first of, I was born and raised in India and have been cooking now for over a decade, so I'd like to think I have a good idea of Indian food. My fiance and I decided to try Passage to India today for lunch. We ordered the Chicken 65 for our appetizer. It was definitely not authentic, it was below average, too much cumin in my opinion and way too much cilantro. But the chicken was tender. We ordered it medium, it was fairly bland ( and I can't really eat spicy food).

I ordered the Chicken Biryani (boneless) and my fiance ordered the Chicken vindaloo, both medium spice level as well. I assumed boneless meant chicken breast, not dark meat without the bone. If I knew that was the case I would not have ordered it and paid extra for boneless chicken. It was full of cilantro (no brown onions at all) and it was more or a bland pulao than biryani. The rice was dry and undercooked and stale tasting. The waitress actually forgot to bring out the rice that is complimentary with the vindaloo and we ended up waiting about 10 minutes till we found another waiter who brought it out for us. This rice too was cold and stale. It definitely was not basmati (didn't have the smell or taste of basmati). Both dishes had no flavor, the vindaloo didn't taste anything like the peppery vinegary dish it was meant to taste like. I have a hard time believing the cooks are Indian.

The food overall was a complete disappointment and I would never recommend this place, especially not for the price. Save your money.",2,5u-Rbuh8ovDWJ17WJv5fuQ

If I could give zero stars I would. I brought my son for possible pink eye and waited more than 3 hours in the waiting room. Then another long wait in the exam room. By this time my son was starving and tired. They could have given me a heads up sooner that it was going to take so long! Turns out there was only one doctor on call that day. To make matters worse a lady with children arrived and checked in the same time as we did got in to see the doctor and left while we waited another hour. I wasn't that impressed with the doctor once we finally saw him. He asked minimal questions and was in the room for no more than 5 minutes. He left and said the nurse would be in to finish up...25 minutes later we are still waiting...they should change their name because they are anything but quick!!,1,eDsSscXXFhOxNVFXZXQLlw
"About a year ago, I was aimlessly strolling thru the Cosmopolitan, taking in all the beauty that the hotel has to offer.  While walking around the Chandelier Bar on the upper floors, I stumbled across a long hallway lined with album covers, with a questionable ending.  What could be at the end? Narnia? Or the Springfield Mystery Spot, complete with Ozzie Smith? Of course, being the quizzical individual that I am, I walked down the hallway.  Couldn't believe what I saw...a walk-up pizza joint!

Anyway, with over 500 reviews, I don't know how this is a secret anymore.  No sign, no advertising, but excellent NY-style pizza.  At $4.50/slice, with the Strip-markup, it's a pretty good value for wasteepants late-night munchies.  And if you're not ready to end the rager, they have beer and I think, boxed wine.

This is obviously a place to go after a night throwin elbows at the club.  At times, I've seen the line full of button-down shirts, fist pumps, sky-high heels, and dresses that leave little to the imagination.  Sometimes the line is long, which is understandable given its popularity.  But they try their best to keep the line moving swiftly.

I'm glad I stumbled onto this place, as it has become a staple when I visit.   I applaud the Cosmopolitan for this inspired idea.",5,SkY2KL1je6jpax22RofK2g

"My husband and I were really excited to move to Sun Prairie about a year ago, especially when we heard of a place called Porktropolis (how could you go wrong??)!

After several attempts to go to the restaurant (they have weird hours, closed a lot of days and close early some days), we finally went on a Friday night.  You get to go in and choose your type of BBQ sauce to put on your meat.  My husband and I each got pulled pork sandwiches with different BBQ sauces.  

What a disappointment!  Like one reviewer said, I wanted to love it but it was not very good.  The pork was incredibly dry and had a weird, greasy consistency at the same time.  My mac and cheese side was really mushy and not very flavorful.  It was a really disappointing experience.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing?  The waitress said that the pulled pork is their signature...

Very disappointed!!!!",2,lpUzI5SX7ka_5EaY1PzReQ

"The food at Samba is excellent in every regard.  

You start your meal at their 40 item salad bar, which is delicious.  It has traditional salad toppings, a variety of pasta salads, interesting vegetables, spanish cheeses, and more.

The meat is the best part though.  They have nine different cuts on any given night, and the cooks come around and slice you off some of whichever meat they are passing around.  The top sirloin was a perfect medium rare and probably their best meat.  The duck was delicious, the flank steak had amazing seasonings on it, and the bacon wrapped tenderloin tasted great.  The rack of lamb had a little too much garlic, but other than that was pretty good and both the leg of lamb and the parmesan pork were delicious.  The sausage they offered was tasty, but did not set itself apart as spectacular.

They have a decent beer selection and the restraunt overall has a wonderfull ambience.  The food is what makes this place special though.",4,Y5IjERadIjXccLu8n-yPeA
"Yay! I am so happy! This place has just opened - right around the corner from my place - and it's fantastic! A family run business where the husband is front of house and the wife and another chef do the cooking. The food is prepared with pride and love and was delicious. For a newly opened restaurant the service was seamless - and even more than that - friendly and generous as we were given an additional appetiser dish on the house. It was a mushroom salad with yuzu dressing that wasn't on the menu but the chef wanted us to try it - and it should be! 
We ordered the Korean pancake (vegetarian), the beef bulgogi, 2x bibimbaps, the tofu and kimchi stew (a fave), and the sweet potato glass noodles (another fave!) and there was plenty of food! Along with the complimentary mushroom salad, we were given kimchi, and some pickles to start and also had cold roasted corn tea (delicious!) so I would say this was a very well priced meal around $25 per person. The food was all very tasty and the portions were generous - we were 5 and we had plenty to try from each dish. 
They are yet to obtain a liquor license so we did not drink. 
I am very happy this restaurant has opened and I wish them every success! Go try it!! Let's keep this neighbourhood full of local, independent and family run businesses like this one! I look forward to returning.",5,aI-cJX7lmFv2REebifT18w
"Great experience.  NY strip steak well prepared and tasty, sides great, and the salad excellent.  Great service including an extra complimentary dessert to celebrate our occasional. Price was consistent with the level of quality and service.  Don't overdress -- we wore coat and tie and dress and probably the only ones in the place.  Business casual would have been fine or a sport jacket.  I'd go back, great steak!",5,SFMRCHjcW5fjsA0Erky3PA
"As I was staying at MGM and didn't want to schlep all over town in 99 degree heat, Fiamma seemed like a good choice, and it was. Great food, great service, and a nice classy atmosphere. it was expensive, but you get what you pay for, I was surprised at the lack of customers on a Friday at 7:30PM (prime time dining) we were the only people at the bar and the dining room was about 3/4 full. We had calamari and Steak Tartar which was good, but the Lobster Gnocchi and Beef Tenderloin were fantastic. I would definitely return",4,LzMIykw9XvPJyAxTL6KbvA
"Horrible. Worst I have been treated since I have been in Phoenix (five years). There are signs on the pumps that state, ""To prevent fraud, all credit card transactions must be done inside."" I thought it odd, but walked inside. The guy who worked there said hi. I said, ""Hi. I'm wondering, why do you have to come inside to pay?"" He said, harshly, ""Did you read the signs?"" I said, ""Yes,"" He said, ""Then you just answered your question, didn't you, buddy? Not too tough, was it?"" I looked at him, incredulous. Seemed like a harmless question. I turned to walk out, saying, ""I think I'll get gas somewhere else."" He said, ""You do that, buddy. No skin off my back.""

Based on the fact that there was nobody else there, I think it probably was. Maybe not the douchebag I talked to, but the owner probably wouldn't appreciate the fact that his employees are treating customers like that.

Well, I guess I'm not a customer.

Never will be, either.",1,y3F-6nJJEunYwEIHGMge3g
"I never heard of this place until my friend invited me to her birthday that was held here. The first thing that set the tone on a negative note was that they didn't have me on guest list when I clearly signed up before the closing time on their official website. I got there around 11:30 and the cover was already $20...I wasn't impressed so far.

The venue is very small compared to all the other clubs I've ever been to. Did I mention that the drinks are priced very high? Second thing that wasn't impressive. However, the music wasn't bad as the night went on.

Overall, the club was alright because of the music and I was with friends. I would give Dolce 3.5 stars but the pricey cover and drinks lowered it down to a 3. I would only go here if there was no cover for ladies before 11...I probably would have to drink a lot prior to entering too.",3,KKIIzd3kq5sSIjR4eCW4Rw
"One of the original Oreganos locations in the state. Tucked away in the lot on the southeast corner of Shea and Scottsdale. I continuously always order either the Beef Bistro salad (amazinggg) or the Alfredo the Dark. The beef bistro is a spicy spinach beef salad, really great never had anything like it. 
Alfredo the dark is their spicy version of Alfredo pasta.
Of course you can't come to Oreganos and not get a pizookie! Absolutely one of the best desserts I've ever had - and I have a sweet tooth. Only $5!",5,bMfLtnlCO34bAVB8X0biBQ
"I don't normally write reviews for restaurants, but our experience here was so good that it deserves to be shared. We walked in without a reservation at 8pm on a rainy Friday night. The hostess graciously offered us our choice of table.  (Btw,why isn't this a standard practice at more places? But I digress). As we were seated and given our menus, the hostess informed us that ""the best table in the house"" was available, and led us to a comfy, cozy, well-lit booth in the back of the restaurant. We're off to a good start so far, I thought to myself. 

But we were only just beginning. 

Our server was very polite and knowledgeable, and the food...was excellent. The portion sizes weren't tiny, but they weren't huge. The spinach salad was perfectly dressed, not overpowering at all, but subtle enough to be noticed. Our entrees were delicious! You can absolutely tell the freshness of the pasta.  Although I will say, the gnocchi was a little soft for our liking. We'll give them a pass though, because the espresso martini may have been the best martini I've ever had. And I didn't think I'd say that about a place in Champaign. 

Throughout our meal, we observed the owner walking the dining room floor and talking to the customers. He personally stopped by our table to ask us about our experience. We were delighted to tell him we'll absolutely be coming back. If you need a nice night out, I highly recommend Nando Milano. Just bring your checkbook, you'll need it.",4,mWLyDedBefQKatfD-xFXdQ
"Our daughter treated her Mom to a dinner here for Mother's Day, and let my son and I tag along. She treated us as well, as it turned out. She loves this place, and I love trying new places, so we were all excited about the dinner. 
Service was sharp, drink orders arrived promptly followed by the smoked salmon appetizer. Very good. Entrées included burgers, blackened chicken, and a pasta dish with Brussel sprouts and a cream sauce. We all enjoyed the dishes. Too full for dessert and had a place to be so we didn't linger long. A great place for a casual dinner or a special occasion, we'll be back. 
The only down side is that I was not wowed by the menu. I found something I enjoyed, so was happy. But I love the places that I have such a hard time ordering because everything looks good, and that wasn't the case for me here.",4,Np-B1QJuBrC5-OqG_4zJIQ

Looking for food at 2 am ...  3 am...  4 am....  head to Pops.  A great food stand in Vegas for a philadelphia cheese stake anytime of the day (24 hours).

"I went to this Hooters on 9/12/17 around 12:00 PM.  The place was dead and should have been in tip top shape.  Not the case.  Under my table, I looked because my child had dropped a crayon, it looked like days worth of old food, crumbs and other debris.  The reason I say this is their were a few Hooters girls on ""break"" taking care of one of their kids while supposedly working while their significant other was there sitting in front of us, for over an hour while other girls continued to sit with them, one of whom was our waitress.  (mind you only one other table had anyone at it.) The manager on duty also took part in this.  The real issue here is I ordered wings with no side dressing, my wife then ordered an extra side, which should have been mine given to her, nope they charged $1 and some change for it.  I had 2 chicken wings out of six in which I found hairs coming in and out of the breading,  (I shave my head so 100% not mine.) I informed this waitress with the response of "" It's prolly just the feathers."" ""would you like to make more.""  No I don't want more the hairs are in the batter.  I'm sorry but I work in customer service, and she should have informed the manager, who vanished after my complaint, to take care of my issue.  Needless to say I paid for six wings, when only four were edible, paid for extra dressing when it was mine just given to my wife.  Place is disgusting and would highly recomend the health department check this place out.  If it was this bad in the front of house and in the food, I can only wonder how horrific it must be in the back of house.  I WOULD LOVE A RESPONSE FROM THE MANAGEMENT OR OWNER TO THIS.",1,iYli09P_PVtlVPE4LGz7tQ
"We haven't been to Mimi's in over 5 years but today we decided to try something different. My husband had the pot pie and I had the shrimp. He would have liked the pot pie better if it was made with dark meat not white. There was so much meat he had a hard time finishing, which is great. They didn't skimp. My shrimp were tiny but the meal came with 10 and two sides. I chose the mash potatoes (yum) and green beans. It was a good meal. They offer a delicious bread basket too. Overall, the food is good and we left satisfied. 
Our server was very nice and on top of things as well!",4,niuc1pw1t8eweObLaZbNGg
"Purchased a brand new 2016 Hyundai Veloster Turbo in February from Antonio Grant. This was my very first purchase on my own as a 24-year-old woman. My family has purchased multiple cars via him. He is the best dealer at this Hyundai location and really goes above and beyond for his customers. Unfortunately, the customer service provided by his fellow peers do not match his. Hopefully, the story below will defer first time buyers like me away from a bad dealership with terrible customer service. 

7/31 Took a hiking trip and made it back home safely when this brand-new car under 7,000 miles battery died. This was odd for me because it is a brand-new car so I didn't understand why the car just died. All my key fobs were not working and no power to the entire car. At this point I was fine because I knew it would be fixed under the warranty. Called Antonio to let him know what was going on, he advised me that I had roadside assistance for 5 years so I called to get the battery jumped, and it didn't work so Antonio asked me to bring the car to the dealership. After arriving there I was immediately greeted (if that's what you call it) with distasteful customer service. A service clerk named Linda chastised me and the representative from the towing company with a negative tone basically asking why we were there and blocking her service area instead of directing us where we needed to go, saw that we were being serviced already and passed us off in an extremely rude manner. Mind you I later saw her help three other customers with the exact opposite kind of attitude, so it's not like she was having a bad day, I'm assuming we were just a problem for her. My normal service representative was busy so I was passed off to another rep to assist in getting a courtesy car. I had to go to get the car myself, and also received it with no gas, after telling the rep three times, he then had it filled. No one asked if I needed help with anything else, or told me when I should be expecting my vehicle, NO ONE ASKED ME FOR THE KEY TO MY CAR AT A CAR DEALERSHIP, and my problems seemed to be an inconvenience to every and anyone at the dealership.

8/2 Went to pick-up the vehicle and showed up with no one inside the facility. After searching, I found the General Manager of the branch who proceeded to walk me to the service area to get my vehicle, I knew he had heard of my experience previously, so out of knowledge of ""good"" customer service, I expected him to ask what happened, but he seemed to show no interest in it. After receiving my vehicle, I told the manager I wouldn't be returning, and all I got was an uninterested ""Sad to hear it,"" and I drove off of the lot. I'm usually not the type to speak on bad service but previously, I've recommended this place to many family members and friends, so I'm doing this in hopes that no one will have to deal with this kind of service again.",1,iM5DkuRHc__DhtzTbskJ5Q

"I hate taking my car to a mechanic because of bad experience. We have been customers here for over ten years. My husband always took our cars to get serviced. This time I had to take my car since the break engine light came on. 
When I arrived to Mr Brake they were closing up. I told the owner what my problem was. He went back in his shop got a tools, told me to open the hood and looked at my car filled it up with brake fluid and told me that I was ok to drive it but to come back in the morning so he can check the brakes. He didn't charge me anything just told me to come back.
He could have told me. He was closed. To come back tomorrow. I really appreciated what he did for me. He is a very carrying and honest person.
Next morning I was there. He worked on my car changed the back brakes. I was very happy by the way he treated me. 
Thank you Mr Brake.",1,Kesr3K6wocotV9vFlYPzFA

"Wow, I can't believe there's only a few reviews of this company.   I met a SunRun sales rep in Costco one day.  I asked him some technical questions with no intent to purchase a system.  A follow up meeting at my house by one of the sales team answered my remaining questions.  It seemed almost too good so I told them I would think about it.  I called some of the other solar installers in Las Vegas and told them the deal.   They told me that they couldn't even come close and would not return my calls for a formal quote.  Yes, that is absolutely true!

We opted to buy out the lease outright which gives us a solar system for 20 years with free maintenance and support the whole time.  The equipment is theirs but I think it's much like a cell phone.  You'll want to upgrade before the end of 20 years anyways.  I calculate my cost to be 8.55 cents per kw/hr compared to that of 13.1 cents per kw/hr of NV Energy.  We only get a $14 bill from the power company now; which is well worth it for the net metering service they provide (which means every ounce of unused solar power produced by the system can be sent to the grid for later use) .  No other costs as everything for the next 20 years was paid upfront.    

I know they are new in town and they wanted to make a good impression with the new trucks and equipment, but they followed through with installers that were exceptionally professional.  They kept me informed during every part of the installation.   They installed the system in only a few days and I was very happy with the end result; both with the solar panel placement on the roof and the inverter placement inside the garage (my preference).

Because I signed up when they were at Costco, we received coupons for free Costco membership renewal and a $500 Costco card.   It takes a while to get both, but they came without me asking for them.

I just couldn't be happier and I don't normally write reviews.  I do, however, use Yelp a lot to decide on services for the house, so I just thought I would take a few minutes and contribute.  I would do this again with SunRun ""in a minute"".  Take a bow SunRun.",1,NBW2zKP2E-ymUu5foWEDOA
"Decent price and its a buffet!

This is only my second different Indian restaurant I have been to. As far as selection of food and by price this is now my favorite. I am still discovering Indian cuisine and so far I really like it. 

Now for those of you that are familiar with Indian cuisine I will say that this is a buffet, so if you like spicy this is not the place for you. However if you want a nice lunch with a good selection at a good price then this place is wonderful. 

The lunch buffet Monday - Friday is only $8.95!

"This is actually one of my favorite places to eat, they have a good variety of creeps, savory crapes, as well as waffles. They're hot chocolate selection is excellent. Their group platters are fantastic, including a need for little roasting hot for your marshmallows. 

We have noticed, however, at that in the past few weeks they have unfortunately decreased the number of servers thing to one person. It takes forever to try to order something, or get the bill, and get the machine for the bill. You don't get checked on as frequently, and usually the waiter on staff, the only waiter, isfrantically trying to serve the customers, and clearly is trying to do the best that they can. 

I think management should consider adding 2 Waiters for the evening service at a minimum, so that the customer service doesn't decline as a result. We still want to continue coming here, we hope this gets resolved soon. We would hate for this please, to be known as ""the place where you have to wait forever"".

"Having seen that the line for the Wynn Buffet was at least a good hour and a half long, my friends and I headed a little further down the hall to the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  The wait was only about 15 minutes; we were seated, given menus, and waited about another 15 minutes for our waitress to come over.  

Once she did she was very pleasant, and got our orders in promptly.  I started with the tomato bisque, which was advertised as coming with a mini grilled cheese sandwich.  Maybe because I got the cup instead of the bowl, it didn't come with one.  The soup was WAY too sweet, but otherwise had good texture, and a nice background kick.  

My entree was sorely disappointing.  I got the carne asada, which was pieces of skirt steak wrapped in corn tortillas with chopped onions and cilantro.  It came with a tomato rice, a tortilla bowl filled with pinto beans and melted cheese, and a little side of salsa.  It was all just so...bla.  Nothing about it was bad; it just wasn't that good.  The tomato rice was probably the most flavorful thing on the plate.  The portion was also way too large.

My dessert was the best part of the meal.  I got the cheesecake sampler, which came with three mini cheescakes on a plate- one plain with 2 fresh blackberries on top, one mango with fresh mango chunks on top, and the other chocolate with a truffle.  The mango was the best out of the three, although the plain was a close second, with a true New York cheesecake flavor and nice graham cracker crust.  My cafe latte was  large and very hot, which is nice since they can often be lukewarm.

The service from start to finish was super sloooow.  It took us TWO HOURS to eat lunch, and we are not slow eaters.  And considering that the delicious Wynn buffet was only $30 for the champagne brunch that day, the $45 + tip that I paid for this mediocre meal was really painful.

The one high point of the experience was the decor and ambiance of the place.  Like the rest of the Wynn, it is fresh, bright, and quirky.  I loved the white plates with sunny yellow borders, the oversized yellow coffee cups, the denim-looking napkins, and the lime green couch with navy border at the entrance.  The lower part of the seating area overlooks the beautiful pool.

Overall, quite disappointing, especially for the price.",3,YXwjMPLuXTwCVzvjoIeWmg

"Why is it nearly impossible to find great Mexican restaurants in Vegas?!!!? I think this place by far might have the best burrito, but it still doesn't come close to the best burritos in Cali. 
Their chips are my fave kind...thin and crispy and doesn't have the oils oil stench. 

The ""cry today cry tomorrow"" dish was REALLY GOOD, the meat was DELICIOUS where it was cooked medium rare, but majority of it was way too rare for me so I got a few bites. I recommend maybe ordering it medium so that they can accomplish the medium rare steak. The sauce wasn't spicy at all and had great flavors! I'll come back and get this next time! 

Service was amazing...i almost felt like some VIP customer and that's how they treat all their customers from my observation. We left a fat til for them because they more than deserved it!!",4,M6u4jA7FHbf0dZ3qMQJQRw
"We love their food and their upstairs bar and patio!  The key lime pie is crazy delicious - some of the best I've personally ever tasted.  The sushi rolls are great, the happy hour appetizer list is generous on both food and drink.  We really enjoy the saki sangrias!  Our last visit was a little disappointing with service as we arrived closer to the end of their business day.  As we always do, we made sure to ask if it was okay to sit at the sushi bar since it appeared they were winding down and getting ready to close.  They assured us they were not closing and that we could sit there, however throughout our meal they pretty much closed up show, put all the chairs up around us at the bar and we generally felt rushed.  We won't be returning for meals at the end of their business day again, however earlier in the day visits are definitely worth the trip!",4,tot35G8jQSObbrCzx0BCoQ
"I love going here. The ramen is so good. Everything I have tried has not disappointed . Thy even offer a vegatarian option but I like substituting the chicken/pork broth for veggie. And , always getting thin noodles. They let you substitute very easily which is great. There pork bun is perfection. Highly recommend the wait .",5,FQeJ8lUnd8eb9HJr2TIhSQ
"Went in for a late night meal, food was kinda bland, but not awful. The server was really friendly but the bar guys were just flat out rude to our happy drunk friend. I realize he was drunk but hey we are in Vegas and having a good time, no need to condescending especially after we all bought food and 6 shots of alcohol.",2,F6Sf5XqXesKwYJmATsMo6A
"A friend who is starting his diet treated a few us to his last big eating out at his favorite place for pizza!   When you first walk in you notice right away all the old photos of actors & New York and the Yankees! On the tv screen was playing the original Superman and on the radio was Frank Sinatra singing to us!  We walked in and were headed to a table when the server asked if it was our 1st time here, we said yes for some of us it was, he then offered us free garlic knots, man that is some heaven in dough! Couldn't get enough of the garlic knots!  We wound up ordering a cheese pizza, which by far is my favorite; it was simple, tomato sauce, cheese and great pizza dough! We also ordered a white pizza with sausage. The white pizza is made with whole milk ricotta, garlic butter & mozzarella, the white pizza was very good, but somehow I can't get used to a pizza with no red sauce. Over all this place was very good! I look forward to tasting my way though their menu!",5,XmXkkAAnUrcNWaWgUV2DSQ
Seriously good Chinese takeout. Very fresh tasting. Not overly salted like some takeout places. Large portions. This is my new go to place for those times when only Chinese takeout will do.,5,lcuZVTih_HpFi1qcGjHVLQ
"My husband and I were on our way to the Tempe Sports Complex to play in my work softball tournament and needed to find a place to get a fast, hearty, and affordable lunch. We had originally planned to go to the Mongolian BBQ place nearby (called YC's, I think) but pulled in and realized that it would probably take too long to do the whole pick your meats, veggies, and sauce thing (we only had 20 minutes or so to get lunch and get to the field). That was when we spotted Gandolfo's and decided to give it a try. 

The menu was huge and really overwhelming, especially since we were in a hurry, but we both just picked something and ordered. He chose the New Yorker (roast beef sandwich served hot with pepper jack, feta, lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperoncini, butter, mayo, and oil and vinegar) and I got the Knickerbocker (which had roast beef, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, oil & vinegar, and salt & pepper) served hot. 

After we paid, we ended up waiting quite a while for our sandwiches  to be prepared, especially given how few people were inside. I probably wouldn't return during a weekday lunch knowing that it's not super-speedy. If you are planning to go there for lunch, make sure it's on a day where you don't need to grab your food and be back ASAP. Maybe calling ahead would help in that case. 

Also, even though the sandwiches were definitely satisfying,  they weren't outstanding. My husband, who's originally from New Jersey, didn't think the sandwiches were nearly as good as ones he's had on the East Coast. And, yes, I know we're in Phoenix, but the restaurant (which is a chain, btw) has chosen to call itself ""New York Delicatessen,"" which in all fairness, can raise a customer's expectations! I also thought the regular size of the sandwich was a bit small. If you are a big eater, I would definitely get the large. Lest you think all I have to say about Gandolfo's sandwiches is negative, I will spend a second praising the hero roll the sandwiches came on, which was freshly baked and super satisfying. 

I would definitely eat at Gandolfo's again if I were in the area and had time to wait for a sandwich, but I'm unlikely to go out of my way for it.",4,XyVdP4WB33zv92ZR0gGrZg
"I can only review based on my one phone call.  She answered Hello instead of the business name.  Then when I asked if she was open, she rudely informed me that she does not take last minute bookings. All of HER clients pre-book.   Extremely rude",1,lowBDX01wLS1XGYVxsd-Qg
I'm between a 3 and 4. Probably 3.5.  Burger was good. Tried my husbands coney dog and it was cold and the dog seemed plasticky. The service was good. The fries were good. Onion rings ok. The double burger is good with 1000 island on it. My son really enjoyed his burger too. The hot dog was the big disappointment. It seemed a little pricey for fast food. I would go back.,4,AhsD2VHcXGnwCXucs3MFeA
"Looking at the reviews that already exist, I feel like there's nothing I can add. The Luxor is one of the oldest hotels on the strip; which makes it one of the oldest hotels on the strip. Iconic for the light beam that shoots into the sky, I don't think they'll ever take that out. The interior of the hotel is certainly dated in this luxury-in-antiquity feel. I kind of enjoyed it. 

The hotel had really good parking and our stuff was safe in the car overnight. The staff was courteous when we spoke to them and even allowed us to extend our stay an extra night without any hassle. The casino tables are no more outrageously priced that other hotels, and you've got walking access to the other hotels as well. 

If I had more time, I would have enjoyed the room a lot more; but as it was - I was able to do work in the suite/lounge area without any issues and the wifi kept connection strong. 

I went the tuesday after labor day and the rates were like $70/night. So timing is everything.",4,JaXvZayy2oJ_uLRWMS5WyA

"First time at Sprinkles and it was in Vegas!!! It was super good. I love the ice cream. We got there around closing time and got our ice cream and chilled inside for a little. We went to the cupcake side and asked the employee to help us take a photo because it was my ""wife's"" first time at Sprinkles. 

The employees were Julie and Ashlen, and they were simply amazing! Even thought it was past 12 midnight, they were helping us take pictures with no complaints. I just want to thank them for making me and my wife's night at Sprinkles. Thank you ladies =]!!

Highly recommended to go there when they are working the closing shifts! love them.",5,6_oV0c0zJnSZzAzZhswtiQ
"Good patio seating... Even though it was a little bit chilly Saturday evening...
We sat outside because we had our 4 legs buddy with us. 
We ordered their pizza, zucchini pasta and few other items.  The drinks options were great as well.  The server was good kept checking on us while we were the only table outside at the time.   We enjoy CPK at this location a lot.  Always delivered with the service and the foods!",4,XfnN7CfiVsftcbDiarGSqQ

"My wife is addicted!  My wallet is sad but my house is looking great!  She love coming here on my days off to just browse, but I almost always end up getting something!

They're always restocking their shelves and bringing out new items so it never gets boring for her. My entire house of decorations were purchased from here. While i'm fine with just white paint on the walls and nothing else, it makes my wife happy to turn our house into a ""home"". If  the items were purchased from a big box store it would be much more expensive, so that is the silver lining. 

They could improve their customer service. They usually are not interested in answering questions. Other than that its a great store.",5,oqTUDCruusF9IPUCdWUlIg
"I had a pretty good experience at Mesa Grill. It made for a great evening. I had the tiger prawn tamale as an appetizer, pork tenderloin & the 16 spice chicken for the entrees, and last but not least, the chocolate sticky toffee pudding for dessert. It all tasted amazing!

The service was pretty good. The meals came out during good times and they cleared our plates efficiently. 

The margaritas that they server here are also great! I would highly recommend them.",4,nH-ICaCinTYDBasnv7407g
"I support owners of local businesses especially when they are passionate about it.  Fran's does that for me.  While dining on the outdoor patio, there's Fran talking to her patrons and keeping everyone on point.  I like that.

I ordered the shredded brussel sprout appetizer and Fran's Meatball entrée on a bed of orzo.  Very good.  The portions were plentiful, too, so they packed up my leftovers to carry home (others did, too, which I consider a good thing).  My server, Tamara did a great job; morever, several other servers were quick to talk, refill my water, etc whenever they saw the need.  Well trained, indeed.

The highlight had to be dessert, which I rarely order.  Key lime cake seemed innocent enough (unless you're my dietician), but holy moly, this piece stood on the plate like the rock of Gibraltar.  It was freakin' huge . . . and awesome, and huge, and awesome.  A true OMG slice of heaven daring me to dig in.  I did!  And I'm coming back for more!",5,D1UrE4aVKO5PbP5MoXs0bg

Both two barbers are friendly and skillful, the one who served me is patient and willing to listen to my opinions.

In all, it is a really nice experience for me.",4,4ie4ypgzCUA9Y_UPlA8YHA
"This place is where I go for a decent breakfast. Everything tastes great and the service is excellent and pretty fast everytime.

"When I last reviewed this place, I criticized them for their lack of dessert selection. Well, I just went back for the same lunch buffet and this time they had little bite-sized pieces of chocolate brownies amongst the desserts. They're really good!

One of the staff was topping up one of the dessert items so I made a comment ""Oh, I see you folks now have brownies..."" He said they've always had brownies for the lunch buffet so maybe they had run out last time I was there.

Anyway, I went and grabbed a handful on my way out the door! LOL",4,Vm0KYSi9i2qAgTKFhdojTw
"Tried out Beauty & Essex opening night! Starts with a gander through a pawn shop. While there are some elegant items, this novelty should wear off relatively quickly. Who wants to buy something in a pawn shop prior to going to dinner? INtriguing?  Enticing?  Elegant interior design throughout! Nice bar too but very small.  
It was opening so they were very overstaffed. It feels a bit bizarre because there is no room in the kitchen for the staff to stand around. They just camp out by your tables.  Service was impeccable for that reason!  Appetizers were spot on delicious but our pork chops very chewy, fatty, and we had to send them back.  The manager was fabulous though, very apologetic and brought out a tenderloin that was to die for, sliced thin and cooked to perfection.  We will go back.",4,mt3gJjtLaTEHmNfZICpJlQ
"I based my review on the pros and cons of the visit that I experienced.

Pros:
1) AMAZING BREAKFAST.  There was freshly cut fruit and condiments of all kinds.  The best part was the made-to-order grill.  Delicious omelets with fresh veges, french toast, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and actual eggs were all made fresh in front of your eyes.
2) Well stocked gym.  It had many treadmills and ellipticals.  Free weights were also available which is kinda rare in hotels these days.
3) Shuttle bus was free and the driver could take you anywhere in a 3 mile radius including the airport.  He was even kind enough to pick me up at the baseball stadium even though it was out of the operating range.

Cons:
1) $5 / day parking fee.
2) My room smelled like the guy before smoked in there
3) The hot water in the shower took forever to heat up.  It was about 5 minutes, no joke.  I could've sworn the hotel ran out of hot water.
4) The card key readers were finicky at best.  It took at least 3 tries before I was able to open my door.  Pulling it out at different speeds didn't matter
5) The internet was also finicky.  First of all it was not free except for Hilton Gold and above members.  The internet wasn't fast and the connection would die quite often.  The wifi was so weak in the bedroom that I gave up trying to use it in there.
6) Very little counter top space at the bathroom sink.",4,lz_RbLopUXh9fLandx7RQg
"Terrible/non-existent service, food was mediocre and took for freaking ever, traditionally non-meat option didn't have meat indicated on menu,on that note, no vegetarian options at all, no water or napkins provided without passive aggressive eye rolling from server.

"Not sure what is about me and my food, but it never fails, something goes horribly wrong. 

Was in there yesterday for a late lunch, I ordered the Seared Tuna Nicoise salad and a glass of the Caymus (or was it Caymay) chardonnay. 

The chardonnay was incredible subtle hints of fruit and a creamy finish. 

Then came the food... They brought out the seared tuna appetizer... did not order that... asked one of the bartenders what this was... it was not the salad so he took it back... then the original bartender came over to apologize.. fine whatever, but could you please ask the kitchen to put the herb dressing and ginger dressing on the side. He said sure and walked back to the kitchen... 

Ok, still waiting... finally it comes out. The salad looked lovely and fresh-really beautiful. The dressing were good (not great), but what ruined my lunch was the tuna... a piece was put on my plate that you couldn't even knife through.. WTF, this is the second time... If I had put that in my mouth, I would have lost it... I am so picky about my sushi... REALLY... the first time this happened with the salmon and now the tuna... 

Ok, so Meghan, the ultra cool manager was not there, instead it was some shitty manager. I brought the cut of meat to his attention, he apologized but reluctantly. 

That really blows... he blows... do I really ever want to go back... probably not. Well at least not for the sushi... I know better than to order sushi so far from the ocean. 

Sorry Cowfish... your sushi grade fish blows. Or your staff for allowing that on a plate (TWICE).",2,0RkL15NHskErrAVYZW7ijA

I tried this place because of all the rave reviews.   Let me tell you this. Simply avoid this unless you enjoy cafeteria type of ""Italian food"" that is served in school lunch halls across the nation.  Yuck!  This guy should be ashamed of himself calling this Italian food.

"I've taken my two boys to several different doctors/PAs with Mesa Pediatrics. Pretty much without exception, everyone has been empathetic, knowledgeable, and has gotten our problems solved quickly.

My only complaint is because of some difficulty contacting the office. They have weird, short hours for answering their phones, and it usually goes to voice mail even during those hours. And although they have a patient portal, it looks like they've turned off the functionality that lets you send secure messages through it.

"Regardless of what anyone says, my experience was not that great. Me and a friend of mine went. He ordered the 'Heart of Darkness,' which he enjoyed, but, not until I ordered a glass of wine. Now, I understand I'm at a tiki bar. I just wanted a damn glass of wine. I ordered it and the pompous bartender was so rude because I didn't feed into his ""hype"" and get a porco drink. Again, I get it, but I was having a wine night and just wanted a glass of wine without being made to feel less than. There is no reason to treat a customer the way he did regardless of what they order. I'm disappointed and unfortunately will not be back",1,AjPNQkBmKwXOqOYXIC2d3g
"Everyone has already written such thorough amazing reviews of this place, but here it goes anyway... my two cents worth.

I, too, have been really curious to check this place out for a while now.  Last night I got my chance.  Though it was the day-of, we still managed to secure a reservation, maybe because it was a Tuesday night.  On the phone, we got a very similar speech to the one we got when making reservations at Lee.  They will only holding the table for 15 minutes and you can only stay for two hours.  Okay fine.

We got there five minutes early and were quickly shown to our table for four.  The rest of the party arrived late, but we had ordered drinks, so no one seemed too concerned.  I ordered the apple cider and took a minute to take in the sights.  I liked the quirky interior... Victorian family portrait with one family member wearing a Stormtrooper mask - I'm feeling it.  Watching the chefs working away was fairly interesting too, though it really didn't help with the noise factor.  Even the trip to the loo was a little bit of an adventure what with all the corner turning and so on.

The food was a hit and a little miss though I really appreciated the eclectic menu.  I was lucky enough that everyone was both really hungry hence ordering a lot but also very willing to share!  The truffle oil popcorn was incredible, the tuna salad was meh,  the calamari a bit disappointing, the curried shrimp and naan very decent, the croquettes passable though I wouldn't order them again, the Fior di latte + mushrooms + truffle oil + spinach was amazing, the Burrata + pesto + eggplant + roasted red peppers was alright, and the beef hotplate was just okay.

This was not a cheap meal, but I must confess, in addition to the many dishes we tried, we also have two bottles of wine on the bill.  Will I return?  I think I'll wait until summer so I can enjoy their lovely patio, but yes, I think I will.",3,YrhLHM2UqF1Cd9MqZi5j9g

"I did a search on Yelp last week about the best breakfast in Vegas and this place came up. Since it was located next door to my hotel we were eager to try it. 

Thursday morning - line out the door, so we skipped it
Saturday morning - line down the stairs, so we skipped it
Monday morning - line out the door, but decided to stay.  The line moved surprisingly quick. 

There were 4 of us at the table and the server was really great. I asked her what she recommended and she went through some things and gave great input. She even suggested that each couple could split a meal and there would be plenty of food to spare. 

But being the gluttons we are, we wanted to try many things so we each ordered something different. What ensued was maybe the best breakfast I've ever had. Everybody loved everything and there was indeed too much food, but it was worth it. 

I also feel it's one of the finer values on the Strip as far as cost. ~$15pp for the best breakfast you're likely to ever have is a bargain",4,IjKY6d3yEtHeDZk29g5ECQ

"I chose WhatAPup to help socialize my 8 week old basset hound. I was able to enrol in the Puppy Socialization class which was an incredibly easy process. Caryn makes it possible to pay for classes online as well as manage your schedule online. So the flexibility of the courses was a really great feature for us as our schedule is very inconsistent. 

We're graduated now but our experience here was memorable to say the least! The puppy social class offered exactly what it stated. The room was very clean and well organized. The instructors were very helpful in answering our questions about my puppies behaviour issues I had been experiencing. Caryn is extremely sweet and you can tell she really loves what she does! The male instructor (Sean I believe his name was?) was one of our favourites! He always seemed to have the perfect treat for our puppy that made her pretty much grovel at his feet!!!!!! Something I thought she'd never have the attention span to do! All instructors had a very pleasant demeanour and seem knowledgable even to your specific breed (impressive)! They gave me a great feel on what to expect when my basset was able to go into the real world and how to encourage good behaviour. 

The only complain I would make would be about the facility itself.. It's very industrial and I'd like them to be able to expand their business into something maybe more inviting? (The building is a bit sketchy on the outside) but the experience was more than I could ask for. I will be enrolling in more classes in the future thats for sure!!",5,tWDSlnf1BVFDSzKH-WP66w

I do not believe the Southern food here is as subtle or ""elegant"" as Okra.  The food here is more down-home and hearty, with some very good dishes and a couple that were not good, but I give extra props to Chef Beckett for hosting specialty dinners and making those nights quite memorable.

I will start with the one glaring negative, and it was the gumbo.  Came for lunch and ordered the gumbo with smoked chicken and grilled andouille.  It was not good.  It lacked the depth of flavor that seafood adds to a gumbo and apart from an overwhelming smoke flavor, there was another off flavor in it that I did not enjoy.  Before this, I ordered the dirty rice balls and these were tasty.  Above average, not mind-blowing, but tasty.

My wife and I also came for two special event dinners here, and like I said, much respect to Chef for hosting.  We came to Fowl Out night for the 7 Chefs Series, and I know Chef Beckett didn't prepare mos of the dishes that night, but it came from his kitchen and the food and service were all phenomenal.  (Except, interestingly, Chef Campbell's hot chicken, which was big but not spicy or flavorful enough.)  Chef Beckett did prepare a smoked duck confit dish that night with dijon spaetzle, garlic chard, and cracklins - this dish was excellent.

The other specialty dinner was to celebrate Chef Sean Brock's new cookbook Heritage.  With recipes from the book, Chef Beckett did not disappoint, turning out dish after dish that were not just evocative of Chef Brock's style and ethos, but spot-on renditions.  My wife and I would know, since we've dined at both Husk and McCrady's.  I would say Chef Beckett's fried chicken skins that night surpassed the chicken skins we had at Husk.

As to the regular menu, the fried green tomatoes are very good, with the pea tendrils an extra plus tot his dish.  The fried okra is serviceable.  The greens were cooked enough (maybe a tad over-cooked),  and both the cider brined pork loin and catfish are quite good.  

So like I said, slight preference for Okra.  But don't fail to miss a special dinner night at Southern Rail.  Those nights tend towards the amazing.",3,58rnTbFVjjvuG-QLTmpCHg

"It's a hole on the wall, but truthfully sometimes those are the best restaurants.  I was craving good Chinese food, I found this place on yelp. After reading reviews I decided to go with my husband and kids. I was expecting a bigger place, the restaurant has only 6 tables. 1- sits 6 ppl, 2-sits 4 and 2-sits 2ppl. It was empty when we walked in, we got to pick and choose the table we wanted. The waiter was very nice, she gave us water right away and waited for us to make up are mind.  I did noticed a lot of orders over the phone. They were very busy with all the phone orders. 

We decided to try the pork wontons, Mongolian beef, sizzling rice with shrimp, low main with chicken and vegetables. They give you complementary egg drop soup and it's delicious. I liked everything I had, except for the sizzling rice. It was ok, I'm was not crazy about. It might just be me but not my favorite. However; everything else we had it was great. The best part is that it's very inexpensive and delicious. We paid $34.32 including 3 sodas. We will be back to try some of the other items on the menu.",4,h2W31TWyMe9Ie-_ZmapLaA
"Foozieh was great.  Very informative. Very no nonsense and to the point.

"Ok, now it's time to talk a little bit about their brunch!  We went for dinner, which was my first review. Dinner was excellent, but on our way in we noticed a sign for their brunch specials on the weekend. Brunch is perhaps my favorite meal of the day, so it was decided --- Mundo brunch for my birthday :-)

We had a table of 6 I think, and were one of only a couple groups in the whole place. I'd love to see this place stay, so I'm hoping more of you will give it a try!

So first things first. Bottomless drinks. For $20 you get either bloody marys or mimosas (in several flavors far more interesting than just OJ). Our server gave us the great idea of one person ordering one, the other ordering the other, and we could mix-match to our hearts desire! Genius since I love bloody marys, but bottomless could weigh you down after awhile. 

Food - I got the Benedict Mexicano --- DELISH.
Jalapeno corn bread instead of english muffin.
Pork carnitas instead of canadian bacon/ham.
Green chile hollandaise instead of normal heavy hollandaise. 
Genius. It was so good, it makes me wonder why Mr. Benedict didn't just make it this way from the beginning.  

Normally I have order envy, where no matter how happy I am with what I order, I covet what my neighbors have. Not this time. I didn't want to trade, I didn't want to share.  I can't even tell you what the other 5 people at my table ordered, but they all loved it too, so I don't think you can go wrong :)",4,KxXpWe5sNiYs8SNI-RsyMA
"We have come to this location several times and it's hit or miss with the food.  We really liked the spicy chicken but on several occasions it was burnt.  We tried the orange chicken and it was our new favorite until this past Saturday evening.  As soon as I saw the orange chicken I knew immediately it was going to be terrible and it was.  It was so overcooked you could not pierce it with a fork or cut it with a knife.  It looked like freeze dried dog treats- I wish I had taken a picture.  I did not bring it back, I ate around it and will never to back. I also overheard the workers in the back talk about one of the customers.  The employees preparing the food do not wear hair nets. Most of the employees we have encountered are very nice- but because we don't know what we are going to get with the food we won't eat here again.  It's too bad- we liked that there was a healthy option close to home.",1,YQh06DvbojNPyqJt_Uj9Rw
"Shopping with your child to purchase their first used car is challenging enough; trying to find the ""best"" used car with little issues seems insurmountable.  With Car Life at Arrowhead, the process of finding my son his first used car  was seemless.  They even helped me walk away from two other cars for my daughter, who is also looking for a solid used vehicle.  By the way, they are both using their own cash.  Inside Car Life, Chris, Greg, and the others were just FANTASTIC.  I have never experienced men who cared more about getting it right than I did - and I thought I loved my kids.

"Disregard the negative reviews here.  You go to this place to get barbecue and that's what these guys know and do best.  My wife and I got the baby back ribs and burnt ends (translation: the good parts of the brisket) which were amazing on their own.  Then add one of their three bbq sauces (we loved the spicy sauce, there's also Tennessee Tangy and a Sweet BBQ sauce) and it makes these meats mouth-watering.  I would go back just for the Baked Beans which are some of the tastiest beans I have had.  The corn side is grilled on the cob then sliced off -- delicious as well.  The owner, George (previously of Fraser's Steakhouse), came out to check on all the guests which was a nice touch.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying the Tri-tip and Turkey!

"Ordered 6 plates to go for my team last month.   I ordered the classic loco moco add mushrooms and onions.   The $1.99 charge for mushrooms and onions was extremely disappointing when I opened my box.  There were 4 small slices of mushrooms and about 13 cents worth of sliced onions that were very tough.  I added the shrooms/onions on 4 loco mocos and all were lacking mushrooms and had bad quality onions. 
I ordered the special ""rib eye loco moco"" which had tough pieces of steak.
Just overall low quality for such an easy meal to put together.",2,uQzbnGtDiOOS21T95BwGkg
"I do not live in Las Vegas, but while here, visited this place 3 times. It's one of those places where you say, ""Damn, I wish I had something like this where I live."" Excellent quality, ambiance, price, and service.

I find most Thai restaurants to be just that - Thai restaurants. If you want Thai food, you go there. So, you'll accept mediocrity. This is NOT one of those places. 

Had so many things off the menu, and everything was excellent. Please support Table Thai. They're awesome.",4,6s4LEin7JUZIOkAwEzjDWw
Had some relatives in town and they wanted BBQ so we scoped out some places and went with this location. The lady attending the counter was very nice and let us sample all of the sauces before placing are order. I went with the pulled pork and ribs combo which was good. The pulled pork was tender-juicy and the ribs fell off the bone and not dry cooked perfect. As a side I went with the collard greens which were fine and I managed to sample the mac n cheese with a piece of beef brisket which was also good. The place inside is not very big and the location is easy to find with parking on the side and some parking out front. I don't visit too many BBQ places through the year but I know a good place to eat when I write a review on it and this place hit the spot I would gladly return to this place when in the mood for BBQ in the Pittsburgh area.,4,N7ZK5AhGxH8VzlvoqqxEuA

"After hearing buzz about this place for sometime, decided to finally pony up to the bar and see what the fuss was about!

Walking into this place, you can tell it's ideally set up to handle the uptown lunch rush.  Plenty of space between the tables, is a great plus.  Even at the peak times, you can have a meal without being jostled and still be able to hear yourself think!

This is where it went downhill.  First timers here will be confused when they are handed a card, menu and wished the best of luck.  Good thing I was lunching it with two veterans.  They showed me the ropes behind the self-service concept (I assume this was supposed to be the charge of the girl at the register, but she wasn't interested).  I ordered a special off the board.  It was billed as pasta with pan fried ham, french blue cheese, arugula, and garlic. What I got was a bit different.

The chef started out by pan frying the ham.  All 4 little cubes of it.  Added the blue cheese (again, missed the portion of cheese I was supposed to get by a WIDE margin).  In what I can only assume was a little kitchen creative liberty, he then substituted spinach for the arugula (spinach = inferior greenery to the almighty arugula).  Finished off the pan sauce with not even enough of a ladle of cream to get the spinach wet!  That's OK though, because his plan all along, I guess, was to add the requisite moisture by not completely straining the pasta from the water before adding it to the pan.  End result was a bland, underseasoned bowl of pasta (and little else) sitting in water.  No bueno.  Accompanying this disappointment was bread (VERY good and fresh baked, actually) and a side salad which was served in a dish big enough to hold 4 pieces of lettuce and one crouton.  

$20 out the door (whaaaaa?).  This place is like a hibachi grill.  You aren't paying for good food.  You're paying for the entertainment of cook to order and ambiance.  Except no one juggles knives in this place.  Luce still reigns supreme for Uptown Italian, both in quality and value, by a country mile.",3,9Sz39JpsHnNXcxuheHE70Q

"Goodne... Graici... Mmmmme! These burgers are absolutely scrumptious! My colleague picked up the burger for me so I can't quite review the pIace. But from what I hear, their business concept is interesting, and their website forwards to a church website every Sunday. 

Now, what I can review is the food; I decided to be not-so-adventurous and opted for the cheeseburger. Here's a breakdown:

Burger Buns: comparable to McDonalds in size, smaller than the Burger King Whopper.

Inside: pick and choose ... I don't go fancy so I had ketchup, mayo, lettuce and tomato. Some other choices? Mustard, onions, pickles, pepper, etc.

Patty: nice and crumbly homemade patty, good flavours. Nice consistency! 

Cheese: the good stuff. Doesn't taste cheap, doesn't taste like cardboard.

Filling? My colleagues usually order 2-3 burgers each... I usually get just 1 because I like it light. It's definitely a lot lighter than your usual burgers.

Sides: fries? I hear the fries aren't that great. But haven't had them, so no comment. 

Price: a burger is about $5.99; that's inexpensive for a nice gourmet burger. 

That's it, folks! Best burger ever.",4,uFgdxi-w5z08n9KrudshGw

"I have been here twice, and both times I have left disappointed. The service has been nice and friendly, but the food is not very good and not worth the money. 

The burgers were super overcooked and dry. It was as if the patties had been sitting on a grill for too long, and they were way too small for the buns. The cheese was a cold kraft single. For the price, you're better off going somewhere like Peter's. 

The regular fries are okay - they're just frozen McCain crinkle cut, but they were fresh and hot with a nice seasoning spice on them, though a bit dry. However, I seriously would recommend staying away from the chilli cheese fries - covered in gross nacho cheese and left me feeling really bad in my stomach.",2,JD1TOWD1rc-sNIUhIYs7dg
"We picked this place to eat after (unsuccessfully) trying to grab a table at Pizziera No 900. Unfortunately, this did not turn into one of those occasions where we miraculously discovered our new favourite dinner spot. 

Our first impressions of La Piazzetta was pretty good; the interior was decorated nicely, and the waiter was friendly and attentive when we walked in. However, after we were seated, it look about 10 minutes to get water and another 10 minutes - after signalling - to get our order placed. There were maybe three or four other tables, so I don't understand the slow service.

Food-wise, this place is nothing spectacular. We ordered a brioche for our appetizer, which was probably the best part of the meal, but it wasn't something that we couldn't recreate at home. My main course, the $17 cheese fondue stuffed pizza(?) was tasteless and small. The side salad was okay. My friend said her Margherita pizza could be found in the freezer section of Provigo. 

Honestly, if it were less expensive, this place might've fared better - but I'm not in the habit of paying $30 for a mediocre meal.",3,XhIThpX8zIctllqDDNPKYQ

"In the age old war between Zaba's and Chipotle, Zaba's always wins out for me.  So much so that while the Eastern location which is closest to me is closed down in preparation of a new location opening soon, I drove all the way to this location instead of just settling for the Chipotle down the street.   That's partially not true as I was somewhat in the area before deciding to get some take-out for lunch, but it was definitely much less convenient than going the Chipotle route and dammit I still took it.

This location seemed much nicer aesthetically than any other Zaba's I've been to.   That's not to say that they usually aren't nice because they are, but something about this one just seemed a step ahead.   It was packed for lunch but the employees were on top of their game in within a few minutes I was out the door with a couple Zaba Bowls to go.   

I did my usual, a zaba bowl with brown rice, shredded beef, corn, green salsa, and lettuce.   It's about as healthy a meal I can put together at any of these fresh-mex joints that I can still enjoy.   I found it to be a good version of the same thing I've gotten 100 times at the Eastern location.   The shredded beef was nicely spiced (I've had it on occasion lack spiciness which I believe is due to it not being stewed long enough to soak it all in) and the veggies were fresh and as tasty as veggies can be.   My rice was a little mushier than I normally like it, so that was my only minor gripe.   I also shared a bag of chips and they were spot on as usual.   

A good value became even better recently with the introduction of the Zaba's reward card with which every 10 entrees purchased you get the 11th free.   Points are doubled on Sundays.   Since I go to the other location at least 2-3 times a week and buy for 2, I average a free entree every 2-3 weeks.   WHAT HAS CHIPOTLE DONE FOR ME LATELY?   Exactly.",4,-FSqorEQeF8_h1fYD7OImQ
"Go here.  Best Mexican for miles around.

I'm a strange breed and, as a Native, love Mexican food of all shapes and sizes.  From greasy, gut rot Bertos, to central Mexico and New Mexican authentic, to high class more fancy Mex in Scottsdale. I love all types of regional Mexican fare.

This place sits nicely in the middle of grease and Scottsdale.  No drive through but you do order from a counter.  The nice part is that if you eat in, your food comes on a actual plate and the guy behind the counter will actually bring it to you with real silverware.

Been here a few time and each time was very good, and cheap to boot.  I recommend the Caminero burro.  Solid beans and salsa too.

Just a nice little family owned spot with a menu similar to most Mexican places with the assortment of burros, enchiladas and tacos.  They just do it a little better here than most places and certainly WAY BETTER than the ripoff, joke of a Mexican restaurant across the street, Top Shelf.

"The Westgate is a conveniently located hotel/casino, attached to the Las Vegas Convention Center. I was in town for a conference, so this hotel was perfect for meeting up with colleagues and for the ease of going to the meetings and then back to my room to rest up. I highly recommend Westgate if you're not needing to be in the middle of the Strip (not walking distance), and if you're at the Conference Center for business. I would not recommend it as a romantic getaway or as a replacement for any of the more ""themed"" hotel/casinos that Vegas is known for. Westgate is a straight-up hotel/casino. No special frills, no theme, no story, no fanciness. It is affordable and a good idea to say hotel moneys in Vegas. The staff at the front desk was super friendly (which I really appreciate). The person checking me in (at 1am) was great to talk to and even upgraded me to a large room at the 28th (out of 29) floor, just so I could have a better view. It was an appreciated gesture and one I will continue to praise. The quality of the room, however, left to be desired... It had obviously not been updated in years (shades of brown, low ceilings, broken bathroom fan, one of the two heaters was broken and only blowing cold air, rust around all bathroom fixtures and broken coffee table in the living room). Colleagues in other rooms, reported their bathrooms being dirty (I did not experience this). With a little remodel love, this could be a great hotel. Nonetheless, I had a good time.

"I came here yesterday evening at about 5:30 and were the first and only in the restaurant.  I waited at least 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated, as the host was no where to be found.  Not a great first impression for a first time customer.  

We were seated and were promptly brought out water and menus.  Since I always get the green curry, Thai hot, and my daughter always orders the chicken skewers, we put out order in before other people had even ordered.  I requested that both dishes come out at the same time since she was eating an appetizer as an entrée.  Her order was brought out 15 minutes later, and mine came out a good 10 minutes after that.   Let me say that I was less than happy, since other tables that ordered well after I did were already being served.  

The curry was good, but was not the best that I've had.  Lacking eggplant if you ask me, but the amount of vegetables was great.  They did Thai spice very well too, as it cleared my sinuses in no time flat.  The portions are very large, definitely enough to share or bring home for another large meal the next day.  The chicken skewers were decent, cold by the time my dish came out though, so my (very picky) daughter hardly touched them after that.

As for the staff, let's just say their personalities were literally the most bland I've ever experienced.  Christ almighty, couldn't get a smile out of any of them...and I'm quite pleasant and fun!  They all seemed like they hated their job, hated life, and at any moment one of them would pull a 12 gauge from the back and start picking off staff and customers before ending it all!  

Not sure if I would come back here...the restaurant is beautiful, the food is pretty good, but aside from the great ambiance, it was lacking, to say the least.  Plus, they play terrible indie electronica music, which, between you and I, makes me think I should be in a gay bar, rather than an upscale Thai restaurant.

Eat here or don't, but you can get better service, food, in almost as pretty of a restaurant that plays authentic Thai music over @ Siam Thai (50th and northern).",3,VCR3Ews0k1bVxUW8wi38Og

"My dad likes this place and requested to go here for his Father's Day lunch. For various reasons, we ended up not going until yesterday...a Friday afternoon...and it was not a good scene. 

First of all, there was no one up front manning the counter so we had to wait...and wait...and wait for someone to come seat us. The restaurant was not busy but for some reason waiting seemed to be the theme of the day. When we were finally seated, we ordered drinks which took an excessively long period of time to get. Then we had to wait some more for our server took our order. She only came over after I went over to another server to ask for some help. Had I not been with my Dad, I would have left. He seemed OK with the waiting but it was 40 minutes before our order was taken...and again, it was NOT busy.  That's just unacceptable. It was another 30 minutes after we ordered for our food to come. So it was well over an hour from the time we sat down to the time our food came and we didn't order anything complicated....a couple of hot sandwiches! And when our food finally did come...it was COLD! I was SO annoyed. I mentioned it to the cashier and he just said oh I'm sorry to hear that. Ugh.

"This is my dental office. We all should have a place that we feel totally comfortable allowing folks to put sharp instruments and sand in our mouths. That is what I am reminded of every time I have an appointment. These folks make me feel totally comfortable about a necessary health task.

Their new office is beautiful and they seem to be settling in well. They could use a little more warmth (rug? color? lower lighting? fish tank?) in the new waiting room. Right now there are just chairs lined up on four white walls, a magazine rack, and a TV high up on one of the walls. A couple of big planters outside the front door would be more welcoming too.

Although I am not crazy about going to the dentist, I really am quite comfortable here when I have to go in for a cleaning, filling, or whatever needs to be done next. The staff always makes me feel welcome and as if their livelihood depended on their customers - oh, wait, it does. A lot of businesses don't get the ""customer service"" part of their business. Tempe Dental Care definitely does. Smiling friendly faces.

Came here couple nights ago.  Good atmosphere.  Very open and large bar area in restaurant.  Service and food were good.  Got trashed again with my quebecois friends (seems to be a trend here in TO).

"AVOID BULWARK AT ALL COSTS. 
We've had Bulwark about 1 year and half now, after moving into a new construction home. We realized that despite paying $100/mo we had lots of bugs and insects in our home. We started to observe the ""technician"" they were sending out and discovered they basically did nothing but wipe down the frames of the windows with a roller? 
So we cancelled. Got written email confirmation our service has been cancelled. They've come three times since then, and charged us for all 3 times despite not wanting service and cancelling. We haven't paid but they're threatening to go to debt collectors so I guess it's against our credit now. 

So, unless you want to pay them until the end of time to not treat your house, I would never use them.",1,cnuAfI8kZq0uvRaTYGJFeA
"Our son began at SpringStone Lakes Montessori School at 18 months of age.  At the time I worried he was too young to be there but I was quickly proven wrong as he developed at lightening speed!  His communication skills improved remarkably fast and the staff taught me that he was capable of much more than I realized.  He is now almost two and can recite his ABCs, count to 20, uses sign language, carries his own food tray, drinks freely from regular cups & even cleans up after himself.  It is 100% due to the expertise and Montessori trained staff at SpringStone.  Their program exposes children to many stimulating activities and subjects from math and science to music, dance and art!  He loves going to school and is in great hands with the caring teachers and staff at SpringStone.  Our kiddo has thrived and we couldn't be happier with his well rounded and continuous development.",5,sXiHgViB9B_omkLZle9x_g

"When I was in high school (this is how all great stories start), I was a regular thrift store starlet, and in those days, thrift store finds could be had for cash that clinked. No paper required. I hate to sound cheap, but these days, thrift stores are pricey. $7 for a pair of trousers that have been who knows where on who knows who doing who knows what? For this reason (and because of the smell), I had sworn off thrifting. 

Alas, being highly vulnerable to pop culture recommendations (Rihanna is, after all, why I drank Jameson for a month), I followed Macklemore on a Thriftshop adventure with a pal in tow. This was our second stop.

It is relatively organized, and it didn't smell stale. Prices were as anticipated a bit higher than I hoped. However, what I do like about Epic is that if you go to their Facebook they have specials every day of the week. For example, next Saturday everything is 50% off! That's the day to go. 

I didn't end up buying anything here or even being tempted by anything, which was a tad disappointing, but they had some interesting highlights: a homemade washer game in the home goods department and quite an impressive record collection. I didn't check the condition of the records, but the covers alone are priceless. Worth mentioning: Rufus and Olivia Newton John. Plus, my pal couldn't resist a 6-cassette tape series on ""The Psychology of Achievement."" She has a casette player in her car. How inspiring.",4,vJiPQnX5mhoKuZatL6AK2Q
"After the pay your day debacle, we decided to go back to make a stuffed animal for my little one. We ended up doing two. First, we had joined the members club, so we used our $15 off voucher for a unicorn. And then we made a birthday bear that costs your child's age. My little one loved both. The store was actually pretty busy and moved rather slow, but everyone e was attentive and friendly.",4,WCZSFow3Tkg6hQoOXnGtLg
I've only ever been to the other location on East but my office is somewhat close to here so we came in for lunch and we asked if they could do the Pud Se Ew even if it wasn't on the lunch menu. They told us absolutely and that they will make it whenever we want! Our food took all of 6mins to be out and it was delicious! We were in and out in 25mins! Service was really great and I can't wait to go back to this location!,5,HP9xQ9xp7QPuUjGOCI_lgw
"Went here for a weekday lunch with my wife.  Service was ok, nothing special.  Nice enough waiter, but nothing memorable, service on this slow side.

Food was fairly unremarkable as well.  I had a salad and a roasted chicken dish - fairly forgettable. 

Interiors were on the nicer side, and lunch was fairly empty, so restaurant felt kind of cavernous, as it is somewhat large and needs a crowd to fill it.

Nothing great or terrible - I found it to be slightly below average for food and service, probably a little nicer than average for decor.",3,oxgymhi8g_dXHVw29LXrtg

"I've had nothing but hard work from this company. I had regular twice monthly cleanings for almost a year. 4 stars instead of 5 because they do sometimes arrive outside the window, but I believe it says on their site that this can happen when other jobs take longer than they expect. It's not been a huge issue for us because we both work from home. The other reason for the 4 stars is because sometimes they would miss wiping down the kitchen/bathroom cabinets, which is something we'd paid extra for above and beyond our bi-weekly service rate. Although, I'm never sure if that is because I didn't make sure to remind them or what. But otherwise they could not be nicer and I loved the job they did every time. I wish we could afford to keep doing it! Unfortunately, when things get tight this is one of those luxuries that has to go first. :(",4,S2ogrvsA8G5OhU_dsscqsQ
"It's a pretty good park. Definitely enjoy the grass and trees, but something prevents it from really being the ""perfect"" 5/5 park it's attempting to be. I don't know if it's the air or the angle of the sun as it sets relative to the park's geographic location. I can't quite pin point the one imperfection that makes it not a 5/5. Maybe its because there isn't a water fountain or public restroom or even a port a john. Maybe it's not 5/5 because the banister on the central gazebo is slightly askew. I'm no park expert but as your average park-goer I can say it's a 4/5 stars!",3,AZqNpeeiwEbo1-B4aM8WPw
"We've been here before, and the food is always delicious.  The last time we went, I had ordered some Havarti cheese to take home.  What I failed to realize was that they had not separated each slice with a piece of paper, so that when I went home and tried to make a sandwich, all I had was a clump of cheese...not slices to work with.

Today we went back, as I had a hankering for a Havarti on rye sandwich.  I kindly asked the gentleman behind the deli counter to put paper in between, and continued to relay my story from my last visit.  He was shocked that someone would be so lazy.  In turn, he sold me 4.25 worth of cheese for 3.00 in order to make it right.  He said he wants his customers to be happy so they'll come back.  He was professional and very nice, and was able to hook us up with everything we wanted.  Because of his attitude about his customers and pride in his job, we will continue to return to Smallman Street for deli purchases as well as meals.  Way to go, guys!",5,o4FvESG5ac9Ei8MKo7_QfA

"To begin with, search for a Groupon coupon before you go here.  For what you get, it is rather pricey unless you use a groupon.  But with a groupon for two or four, it is an OK deal.  All the food offerings are OK -- nothing spectacular or special, but not bad.  We had 5 of us and ordered 3 apps -- 2 cold (smoked salmon with capers and the cured meats and cheese plate) and one hot (shrimps with garlic and olive oil).  The cold ones were 4 stars, and hot one maybe 3 stars.  We had paella (2) and chicken over pasta with a creamy cheese sauce....sorta like a Spanish version of chicken alfredo.

"What a terrible experience. Have always gone to the one in China town and that one is great. Was close by so figured it would be the same. Boy was I wrong. This young blonde girl who started as our waitress (I told them to not send her back) seemed to be on drugs or left her brain at home. We ordered 1 lbs of baby spice shrimp butter garlic, 1 lbs of lemon pepper medium, 1 lbs of lemon pepper medium with corn, 3 rice, 2 waters,  and 1 unsweetened tea. First she brought me raspberry tea, corrected her it was unsweetened tea, brought it to me with sugar on the side. Smh. Food got here and got about 1 1/2 lbs of the butter garlic that was the complete opposite of baby spice. Then the other 1 lbs bags were about half a pound, and one was missing corn. Had to constantly ask for refills on my tea. My auntie wanted the least hot spice, and got the hottest on the menu, no wonder she was so miserable by the time we finished. I will NEVER come back to this location,  now as I'm writing this and get my check, she brings my check with charging me 4 lbs. Looking for the GM. This place is a joke. Stand by..... Ok so GM tried to fix the ticket and messed that up. Ended up leaving being charged for 2lbs, 3 rice, 1 corn. Sure hope this GM can turn this place around.",1,2eqpfXRe7NxY4bYwzMdSHQ

I had them replace my windshield on my 05 Volvo and they broke 6 clips to hold down my side molding on my car so I called them and they came down and said they didn't have the clips and had to get it from a dealer. So then they go and put window sealant under my molding! I had to run out and stop them but it was too late, it was oozing out from every side. I told them I was going to take it to a dealer to fix the molding and replace the clips because their people screwed up the molding by putting sealant. And they said it was ok, I spoke to a man named Eddie. And he said it was ok. I fax the invoice to them and they refuse to pay!!! To fix their mistake cost more than the windshield itself!

"I am a coffee-lover. Love, love, love. But I went on a three week cleanse where I had to cut out all coffee. And while I felt pretty grumpy about it for awhile, a friend and I discovered this great tea place. And I am so glad I did. There are a lot of reasons why it's a great place.
1. The tea! The selection is huge. There are so many kinds to chose from, non-caffeinated, caffeinated, blends, white, roobios, black, green, chai, fruit and on and on and on. They'll make it hot or cold or even blended up with fruit like a smoothie. 
2. The knowledge. I'm pretty new to the tea scene (coffee-addict, remember?) so I know very little about the different teas, what pairs well together and what kind I like. I asked a ton of questions and the guy ( I think it was the owner, super friendly) answered them all patiently, let me smell the different teas and offered his suggestions. I got an iced Calypso Green Tea with coconut milk and it really surprised me how much I reallllllly liked it. Kudos PuraTea.
3. All their teas (loose-leaf) can be purchased by the ounce and the prices are fantastic!
4. They have alternative milks - I had their coconut milk, no sugar added and I think they have one other choice. They use honey as their sweetener if you want it sweet. 
5. The space. It's nothing special from the outside but the inside is very cozy. Games, books, puzzles and a lot of seating to sit and just hang out. Which is what we did! 

Quiet and real chill place. Can't say enough good things. I'm looking forward to making all the different teas I bought. You can tell they really love tea and have a passion for what they are doing and that sure makes a big difference.",5,8E1rf43VKCSV9EaYNwh_EA

"St. Viateur Bagel Shop proffers an admirable simplicity. Bagels (mostly sesame) are served warm from a giant metal sluice that sits next to a table where an aproned man whacks and shapes dough he then shoves, on large trays, into the oven (whence they spill forth via the sluice). There's a refrigerator case stocked with bagel-angled groceries: many varieties of cream cheese, two or three of capers, half a dozen smoked salmon options, and several salmon spreads; a few jams, butter, and some stuff we failed to note. There's another small refrigerator with non-alcoholic drinks. 

The drawback is that the bagels suck. 

""Suck"" is too strong, but we'd been advised that Montréal's bagel scene rivals New York's, and that turns out to be a lunatic's delusion. In flavor, this dough isn't far from a simple street pretzel. What a street pretzel has that these bagels lack, of course, is a thick pelt of salt. Any flavor you get at St. Viateur comes from that refrigerator. The bagels give you a warm smooshy vessel for salmon, cheese, jam, etc., thus fulfilling only the most rudimentary function of a bagel. 

It was late, though; we had played a show and everything else was closed; and so we fell onto the St. Viateur bagels like half-starved hyenas stumbling across an unguarded scrum of newborn kittens (must happen sometimes). Given the strictly-takeout nature of the spot, that meant huddling around a tiny ersatz picnic blanket of paper bags on the sidewalk out front, scooping and spreading cream cheese and sawing salmon with little plastic knives no stiffer than stir sticks. 

There's something attractive about the rudimetary nature of these bagels. Like inchoate little vertebrates crawling out of the sea on their journey to articulated limbs and teeth and wings, St. Viateur's product arouses in the modern mammal an instinctive gratitude. That's not to say, though, we'd ever elect willingly to shed our teeth and thumbs, our poppy seeds and garlic and swirls of pumpernickel.",4,WOgA1sidII-iwfNIiyXg_A
"Have been here twice now and had a great experience both times. Last time, my wife and I sat at the ""chefs bar"" and chatted with Darren most of the night, was a great experience and really cool to gain some insight to a very fast moving little kitchen with a focus on quality and consistency. Saw more than a few dishes not make the pass as Darren inspected every dish before handing over to ensure it was absolutely perfect. Food was ridiculous good, drinks also very good although I would maybe like to see one more rotating local tap. Prices are not cheap, but quality is top notch and I certainly left feeling that I got all of my moneys worth.

Their store employees are great and if you have any questions about yarn or knitting, they are more than happy to give you their advice.

Price was 20.99 for a weekend dinner which is not too bad. The catch is that the menu was limited. Don't expect anything fancy. 

One thing to watch for is that pop isn't included although the ayce menu said so. We were charged $1.50 for pop with refills when the bill came. Otherwise service was attentive. Tea was quickly refilled and plates were taken away when emptied.",4,xljVQM3t92pjte8jZ7ezsA

I really like the hotel/casino but can't stand the walk back and forth to the Wynn for additional/better food options.

I had view of the strip which was really nice as well.",3,NDxVvhQcUzchPqQdOspWvg
This place is currently being remodeled. We were in a low end tower due to our flight getting in late and them giving our room aways. The room had mold in it and half of the electrical plugs did not work. Then at the last min they move us to a different tower which was cool the room is updated and very clean and quiet. Now there was only one pool open due to renovations but the pool on the 24 floor was dirty due to them not shocking it with cleaning solution more often so we didnt get to enjoy the pool at all.

I came here because I could feel my brakes grinding when I would stop.  They told me my rotors were shot and I had a few other issues that needed attention.  At the time I thought that was fine and paid the $800 for the new pads and rotors and various other things.  I came back in a few weeks later to get my oil changed and was shown that color chart for brake fluid and was told it was awful and the price to have my brake fluid flushed...  I asked the guy why they would not have done that when replacing the brakes and he fumbled over his words and told me they would do it free of charge.  At the end he claimed that sometimes there will be residue after they clean out the brakes and that is what had happened...  Do not trust these people!

We went back to pick up the glasses (they're Tag Heuer-made in France-very nice) the next week and tried the contacts on. Dr. Baht hit the nail on the head right outta the gate. The glasses are perfect and the contacts, although the manufacturer doesn't make as many sizes as they could, are working very well for both distance and close up vision. Very impressive - we expected the need to return to try multiple types so were pleasantly surprised. The office is modern and comfortable. Great selection of eye glasses and sunglasses.

"I've been wanting to come to L'Express for years and I finally got to make my dreams come true last night when my boyfriend took me here for a romantic tete-a-tete. 

From the get go, we were greeted by the host, a very kind gentleman who happily lead us to our table. Right away, my boo and I ordered glasses of beers while we enjoyed some bread and gherkins and waited to place our orders. 
We ordered our wine (Le St. Chinian), entrées -- both got onglets done medium rare. The cuts were small according to my partner (he's a big boy = big appetite) but I thought it was perfection. The fries were divine as well, while my boy got mashed potatoes (he has a peanut allergy and they do deep fry their fries in peanut oil) which he thoroughly enjoyed. 

Everything was beyond delicious but my favourite part was definitely dessert. We got the cheese cake and I honestly believe that it is the best cheese cake I have ever eaten in my life. That and my cappuccino and we had ourselves a perfect evening over a delicious, unforgetful meal. 

The service was prompt and very friendly, yet remained very professional. I honestly have no complaints about L'Express. The only one thing I have to say is why is it so good? I have to go back sooner than later now! haha!

Factors of annoyance: certainly the birds can catch you off guard a little; what can you say, they're jus .. Birds .. That's what they do.. Am not sure if the management could or should do anything about this, I don't have an opinion on this at this point, but left to me, I'd prefer not to have those birds super close to the food.

Now the good parts- the wait time was pretty accurate, they brought the food out in time, and as my rating reflects, the food was just delicious! We had the crab Benedict and French toast, both very well made and presented. 

Gabriel was our waiter and he was terrific! Informative and good humored; simple enough you'd think, but those are two qualities that have become quite hard to find  of late at restaurants (yeah am talking about a bunch of other Vegas joints including Gordon Ramsay's burgr)

Target RIP.
Honestly other than the DMV, WINNERS; horrible mall.
It's a bad design, feels old, not modern.
Terrible food court, demolish; start over (but who's gonna rent??).

If you're looking for great pizza and something that's worth the money definitely go to Stumpy's and get their butcher Pizza it has all the meats there cheese is amazing there sauce is so good they're definitely a pizza place that we don't mind driving 20 to 30 minutes out of our way to get their food.,5,6qH7dAjjqjAdp_S-25YDyA
"Finally have a Ramen restaurant close to home. We had their crazy spicy ramen and curry rice and they were both great. We also tried the takowasa octopus which was really good too. The restaurant is clean and the service is friendly so we will be back.

"Considering the general lack of Caribbean restaurants in greater Cleveland, this place is as good as it gets! I mean, where else can you get Mangu around here?

"The pork bone soup is not the best but I still like it. One thing I don't like about the pork bone soup is that's no protein. It's like eating a soup with a bone in it. There's hardly meat at all. Well on bright side meat is unhealthy especially pork so I tend to think oh well I ate less of  bad thing. . 
I came here with my sis 2 am in the morning it was fun experience lol... there were other people as well so it wasn't awkward. the pork bone soup tasted better than when we ate at lunch or dinner for some reason.  ( we weren't drunk for one thing) I think if there are less orders in the restaurant the food tends to be better.

 I recommend this place XD",4,7FDqPQQuYaQRRmO9PHZzTw
I went there on my trip to Vegas. It was a hidden gem in a strip mall. The staff was  really friendly and the vibe is family friendly. We had the white and cheese pizza. It was fantastic. But the highlight was the egg plant Parmesan dinner. It was succulent and so flavorful. I will definitely be back if I'm in the area.,4,KXwZ8w2eCHZA6wflCnrhKg

"Excellent location, close to Kensington Market. 

It's definitely a favourite spot for a pint or two when in the area. It's even worth a special trip for the various bands/events/televised football (soccer) games. 
I think I've seen more selfies taken in their washrooms posted than from any other area pub. They are decorated pretty cool!

As mentioned, the pints feature a great selection of both difficult to find imports and domestic items. 

The vegan food options, although limited, are available. I had the vegan shepherds pie and thought it was fantastic. Fairly priced and well presented, along with accompanying side salad. I was stuffed!

The service was friendly and competent. 

Will be back. Again and again.",4,ynF-WD-11AcpNAcoroOpjw
"Staff:
Friendly waitress

Place:
Brand new, big, modern, bar, nice patio...

Service:
Pretty slow.... 

Food: 
I ordered:
- 1 Veggie Gluten free-pizza, ($16)
pizza was ok, pretty large

- side of potatoes ($6) expensive and not really tasty. they don't have fries! 

- Strawberry Lime Mojito: pretty good and strong.

- fountain drink ( ginger ale) : no taste , too watery.

They have a huge menu selection , (a bit pricey ) almost confusing...

I think next time I want just a pizza and fries I'll go to a real pizzeria....",3,Z29EwOcoFiwKkrkKRiiSfw

"Ugh.  Where do I start?

I stayed at the Tropicana on a quick weekend trip to Vegas for a convention that was next door at the MGM Grand.  The Grand wanted $300 a night thanks to a Def Leppard concert going on that weekend but the dear, sweet Tropicana was selling rooms for a mere $85 a night.  What a deal I thought, only to find out the old adage ""you get what you pay for"" is true.

I wanted to like the Tropicana for pure nostalgia reasons.  The hotel is one of the last Vegas originals still hanging on and was a prime spot back in the Sinatra days so when I got to my room in the Island Tower I tried to close my eyes and pretend like I didn't see the white stains all over the couch and desk chair.  Or the brown stains on the sofa.  Or the bamboo styled bed that had a mirror going up the wall and over the bed.  Truth be told my room had a smell that I couldn't place.  The entire experience was a mysterious adventure with suspect results.

To get to the Island Tower you have to walk down a very long corridor with many vendors selling cheap knock offs of mostly glitter tops and light up buttons, cheap jewelry and hair extensions.  They have a buffet that serves fatty prime rib and french toast; luckily it is all you can eat.

The Tropicana is located at the end of the strip near MGM Grand, New York, New York and Mandalay Bay.  You should stay here for cheap cost and location.  Expect nothing from the casino and hold your nose.",2,70VVkufCoYXtipO7izIOKw
"Overall 5! 

Host was very courteous and service was fantastic. Darla was so great to us. Of course the restaurant was busy on Valentine's Day but she was attentive and kind throughout. 
The naked cowboy oysters were delicious and the stone crab is always a winner. Great place for decently priced filet with a Art Deco feel. Atmosphere is reminiscent of 1930s. Great spot!",5,zmsny9HAXl3QuoPu9tHkJA
"I live in Tucson and decided to meet up at The Farm Kitchen with a few Phoenix girl friends. This place is the ultimate location to catch up and relax on a beautiful day. We sat outside in a grassy area with tons of trees and picnic tables. it was very picturesque. There are three different restaurants one for brunch, for dinner, and then a grab and go type restaurant. We did the grab and go, the food was ok, nothing to write home about and a bit expensive. You are paying for the location and the farm fresh food. They also have a CSA and a great little artist studio. If you are looking for a wonderful place to catch up with a great friend, try The Farm Kitchen!",3,VJiToYImv03CNOFFLakfNg

"Came here on a Friday night with the whole fam. We were seated promptly. Impeccable service. Our needs were always met by the staff. We didnt have to ask for water refills as the water goblets were filled at one half full. 

The interiors is very classy and old world Europe. The waiters had a suit on which added to its ambiance. The clientele, however, was a bit too casual for my taste on that particular evening. I was expecting dressy and stuffy. But I got shirts and shorts. But as it is Vegas and summer, I guess I was expecting too much. Some people were dressy so it balanced out my expectation for that evening. 

With Zin in our hands, it was time to finally order. They have a limited but good
menu. Not a lot of variety, but I prefer quality over quantity so I was perfectly fine with the menu. After putting on our order, we had to wait for a long while to get our actual orders.  

Being a French restaurant and as with everything in France, it took ""forever"" to get our meal. Although after the first bite, we were all convinced that the food was really good and that it was the right restaurant for the whole family to enjoy on a Friday night on a Vegas weekend getaway.

Our bill for a family of 8 was $$$ and nearing $$$$. No one paid attention and were all in agreement that it was worth it. 

So I would recommend this restaurant for casual yet elegant dining.",4,oC0CHbmgakpygPoJ9toYNg

"Best corned beef?  Tired of restaurants giving themselves titles and accolades.  My Reuben was ok, meat was a bit fatty and not stacked that high, sauerkraut was sparse and flavorless, and why dressing on the side?  They also need a stronger rye.  Spicy fries are good and the give you a generous portion.  Service was quick, accurate and friendly.  I just wasn't impressed.",3,xLBfuCot7cEV3Rx-FSqKnA
"I stopped here today to pick up dinner. First impression: very clean, nicely set up dining area, very friendly young staff. I ordered Mu-shu Shrimp (not on the menu but the chef did it at my request with no issue). Also ordered BBQ Pork appetizer, Crab Rangoons and Pot Stickers.
The Mu-shu Shrimp was very fresh with all the shredded cabbage, mushrooms, etc- stir fried and flavorful. A nice surprise because I haven't had good Chinese food since I moved to AZ in 1998. 
The BBQ Pork was delicious!!! Tender, juicy, sliced and presented so well even in the take out box! Some of the best BBQ pork I've had in years!
Pot Stickers were a little on the blah side, simply for lack of seasoning in the meat filling. If there were more filling that was a bit more seasoned they would be better. I found them to be a bit overdone. 
The Crab Rangoons, big kudos to this restaurant for actually mixing crab in with the cream cheese!!! Now, I don't know if it's real crab or imitation because it was so blended together, but I was impressed. Also, the wonton wrapper used is very thin so these are a bit lighter than the usual Deep fried cheese that most places give us. 
Overall, a very good takeout experience. They make Peking Duck there, so I will be back to dine there and try it. I am a HUGE Peking Duck fan!! 
This place is a nice change from the heavy, greasy, gross Panda Express, Yan's type places that deep fry almost everything as is usual with Americanized Chinese food (that we all know is not real Chinese food)... There are no crab Rangoons in chinese restaurants in china. Duh. I think people will enjoy this better (while not authentic) option on the west side.",4,mS0DpUA6h2UyLvKh76QyIA

"I had an adequate experience. I took a bus to Buffalo. I found on arriving at the terminal there was little signage or instruction on what I should do so I waited in line to see an employee. In the end she told me because I had booked and printed online I didn't need to do anything so to just take my bag outside and wait. The seat was comfortable enough. There was wifi and an electrical outlet. Boarding is a cluster-. There aren't really signs to tell you where to be and people kind of spill out of lines into areas the busses have to pull into. The only major annoyance was that the trip took an extra two hours each way due to boarder delays but that's not the bus line's fault. All in all, I'd do it again. Way cheaper than flying and not as terrible as the gossip would have you believe.",4,ftc_C93_F8YluZz2Ng7y3Q
"We enjoy the occasional burro or taco and when we moved from central Phx we were saddened to see that there were no Fili-B's close by. We stopped going out of our way for other locations mainly because the customer service was always lacking and the drive was a little too far. 
This Filibertos opened recently and my husband and I decided to give it a shot. Customer service is top notch! It's close to home and worth stopping in for a taco Tuesday or Sunday morning burrito. 
Our love for all things carne asada and tacos has been revived! Knowing that the owners are working hard behind the counters, always smiling faces and great food! 
Welcome to the neighborhood!!",5,LfwmT9c26NYcKhWZ07G9Kg

The larb chicken has bits of bones ground up in it too - I'm not Thai so I don't know if this is how it is supposed to be, but be warned. We also usually get the pineapple fried rice and duck curry. Both of which are delicious. Definitely recommend coming here for a more casual Thai dining experience.",4,nx449O91p7X6Lk7iY2A-GQ
"We waited 1 hr and 10 minutes from the time we got on line until we drove off the lot. It was 50min until we even reached the counter!! I have never ever in my life had to wait so long for any rental car (and I've rented many cars in my day). Fortunately this gave us plenty of time to head off this insurance issue we kept hearing about, where they make you verify that your insurance or credit card covers a rental car. I called up my credit card company and they immediately sent me a confirmation by email so we were armed when we got to the counter. The lady at the counter was a complete flakey ditz living in fairyland, and no wonder it took so long. She couldn't operate the printer for our barcode and forgot to give us our confirmation papers. This company is a mess and I predict they will go out of business soon with their horrible customer service.",1,1xViJUSRQcRphaVWFhiY0Q
"Yes, another 5 stars from me!  We have been here twice in the evening and only in the bar car which we absolutely enjoy. We were pleasantly surprised at what was behind the shiny exterior of this hidden treasure in Cleveland Heights. In fact, I would say that we were elated upon finding this place.

I would surmise there are perhaps two different experiences in this restaurant with regard to atmosphere and service as well as time of day visited. I am surprised the overall rating for this place isn't higher. 

First off, the bartenders here are superior in their creations of cocktails.They are masters of mixology and to watch them create is a pleasure itself.  The offerings are quite exquisite. I am so happy they have absinthe and chartreuse!  The GINNTANG drink is beautiful and sooooo delicious! The menu lists a pitcher of ABSINTHE if you are daring enough to order such an extravagance. This is on my list of future ""to do's"" as I look forward to a night of hallucinations and bizarre dreaming (if you have ever had absinthe, you will know what I mean)!!!
 
The food is very good!  Everything we have tried so far has been perfect. The Katz Club sandwich was beautifully presented and oh so tasty! The Vegan Curried Lentil Soup is unique in flavor.  The Spinach and Frisee salad was also very good and has fresh, crisp ingredients. Add the chicken to the salad and it will deliver a smooth, smoky overall flavor to the dish. We even had room for a piece of their birthday cake which was ""melt in your mouth"" texture and deliciously sweet in the right way. 

The bar car has such a cool vibe and the lighting gives it such a sexy ambiance. They had soft R&B playing in the background which we love so much. I truly feel happy and relaxed when I am sitting in this hideaway. I have to say that I find this place to be one of my absolute favorites in the area. 

I highly recommend the Katz Club Diner to anyone who is looking for a relaxed, slower paced evening where you want to enjoy a special libation and delicious food in a ""speak easy"" environment.",5,TNeTrEgv8U90-iR2or66-g
"Love the tripel!!!  Love a couple of the other beers too, but kept going back to the tripel.    

DOWNSIDE:
This place has TV playing.  College boys with hot girlfriends sitting at cocktail tables with their heads cocked to the side watching lame TV shows.  They have dialog TV, not music videos.  It felt kinda like having beers with friends at a chess tournament instead of a bar...I asked the bartender if they could put some music on.  He said, ""Yes,"" but 15 minutes later there still wasn't any.  

So I brought my guitar in and started a sing-along with my group of friends who were with me.  Several people throughout the bar came over and started singing with us.  Someone even bought my 3 beers before my tab came.  It seems management doesn't understand that part of a Friday night bar scene, is music.  

I advise to drop the dry dialog non-funny TV shows.  Unless perhaps no music is their bar niche.  I guess there are those who don't like music.  Of course singing our own songs for 45 minutes at the top of our lungs was a blast for my group. Not sure how they felt about it, but they didn't kick us out.",3,HEbibepjK_fX5PBMMB11RA
"Great to have a Viet place that actually tastes good and close to home. Viet Bistro is much closer but disappointing. We were warnly greeted by one of the owners, Ken, who promptly took our drink order and made recomendations. Ice Tea (no sugar) and hot tea are on the house.

For the appetizer, we shared the Shredded Pork with Skin Spring Rolls.  I had the small combo pho ($8,50). Broth was very falvorful and natural (no MSG that I could detect). I did tell Ken that our other favorite Viet place, Pho Saigon 8, small portion had a little more noodles which would probably cost them less than a quarter, but will increase the ""perceived value."" Wife had the Pork Chop with Egg Loaf and Rice. Beautifully presented and tasty. Our friend ordered a spicy thick noodle with broth and I forget the name. 

Definitely will go back and support the place!",4,2j7al0KOCFSAGFbBJGW9Jg
"I love 9 round!  This is a great concept to add to any fitness routine, especially if you are one that suffers from being ""bored"" while working out.     

So, just like the name states, you have 9 rounds to complete in 30 minutes.  Each round is 3 minutes and there is a 30 second ""active rest"" inbetween rounds.  Each round combines cardio, core and strength so you are ensured a total body workout.  This is somewhat of a ""kickboxing fusion"" concept so at a few of the rounds you put your boxing gloves on and go to town on a punching bag!  It is actually quite refreshing and a great way to release tension after a long day at work!  

The stations change every day so you are constantly ""tricking"" your body which is a great way to see results.  You will  see a variety of moves like jump roping, squats, burpees, planks, roundhouse kicks, various punches, pushups, dips, etc

This is a great place for all fitness levels.  The trainers challenge you along the way or they can modify if you have any injuries.  Everyone is super nice, the music is fun and the workout is awesome!!  Give them a try!  This is a very affordable way to get a very personalized workout that will meet all fitness goals!",5,6nJh6qd9okaDKzzhsD-yzg

"One of the worst experiences I have ever had with a company.  We arrived at the agency at the Venetian  in Las Vegas. Our first complaint was that there was absolutely no one at the counter along with no sign posted when they would be back. So after 30 aggravating minutes, the representative decided to do her job and return to work. She was not very friendly and was very short with us. She did not explain many options that we could add on for the car. After all this, she informed us ""we were receiving a free upgrade"". When we walked to our car, we walked to a Nissan Versa. This was no upgrade. On top of the lies we were told, the car was not filled with gas. We took the car anyway and headed to San Diego. We woke up the next morning (New Years Day) and had planned to see a few sights before the car needed to be returned at our hotel in La Jolla. We went to the counter to confirm our time of return (which is suppose to be 30 minutes after the rental began in the first place). Well, the rep here tells us she is only open until noon and the car must be back by this time. There was absolutely NO notice of this at all and we were NEVER informed that Avis would be closing early. The rep was pretty rude and definitely showed she did not care much about our situation. After this, she went out to check the car. When she came back, she tried to charge our rental with gas money because the tank was 3/4 full (which was more full than the 1/2 tank we got when we picked up the car). She argued with me for about five minutes and I refused to pay any extra money, especially because we were returning at 9 am instead of the 4 pm we were expecting. Any way, we ended up taking a cab to what we had planned which was $100 total. I called Avis' costumer service number and they showed absolutely no interest in my complaint. I have rented from Hertz before and I know this would NEVER happen. Avoid Avis at all costs. They don't try harder.",1,6su88mogk0MJqT8LtdpAMg

"We really tried to like this place. Tried it 3 times. This last time sealed their fate- never again. Pros is real white meat chicken, and the veggie rolls are good. Everything else has been disappointing. Tried the orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, and the won ton soup. The sauces are off, the veggies never taste fresh, and it all has a weird after taste (maybe the oil used?) For the long wait times and price, not worth it. I really wanted to like it, though.",2,PrPF0e-3VbjmMJPnqnYj7w
"It was our first time there and at first, I didn't feel welcomed but since they were busy, I didn't let it get to me. We had to wait quite sometime for the server to take our order but it wasn't that big of a deal. My fiancé didn't get to order what he initially wanted to since they were out so he ended up ordering the Gumbo and I ordered three pieces of fried chicken with mac n cheese, cabbage, and yams! Everything was scrumptious and can't wait to go back to try something new. The Sugar Daddy was delish, a must try! 

Our server made sure we were good and also picked out my sides and drink because I was being indecisive. One cool thing about this spot is they have famous people dine in and on the night we came in, someone from a reality show was there (can you tell I rarely watch tv?).",5,JMRSEOBnPztp-V1_Tw9LRA

Pertect place to take you children. They have a huge selection of kid friendly items on the menu  (my six year old Son loves it there and do so I)   but the best part about Cafe Io is the grown up food.

"I was excited another taiyaki place opened up. I went to get their red bean and custard taiyaki's. It was very disappointing. The red bean was very hard and dry. It was also overly sweet to the point where sugar is all you can taste. I also didn't get a lot of red bean in mine. The custard was weirdly lumpy and nonexistent. It think it might've melted into the bread. The taiyaki bread is also pretty sweet. Overall, not good. Hopefully their ice cream taiyaki's taste better. The store inside was quite nice though. They have many spots for instagram pictures.",2,23ad5iFv82fUYGHIWWaIYQ
"I joined the LA fitness in Markham because it is conveniently located near my office. I paid a 200$ start up fee and now 33$ per month. My sales rep. was sociable and professional and I was comfortable with the arranged payment plan. But what does that money get me?

The gym is less then a year old so the equipment and building are new and clean. With the appalling exception of the showers. There seems to always be at least two that are out-of-order, and the grime on them makes no sense what so ever for the time they have been in use.

Condos have created an arms race in the form of amenities they offer their residences. With increased competition fitness centers have begun a similar war to draw clients. Below are the amenities the Markham LA fitness offers and does not offer.

Offers

Basket Ball court- Not a full court size and always packed

Spin room - Lots of nice new bikes

Personal Training - I have only been bothered once about doing a fitness assessment 

Pool - much like the basket ball court, it is available but more so just to say they have one. Its barely bigger then a waiting pool

Yoga/ fitness class - Have not attended myself but I see them going on regularly 

juice bar - over priced

kids center - if I were a parent I would be appreciative 

Does not offer

Squash courts - squash is available at some LA fitness but only with a premium membership usually 5$ extra pre month

olympic lifting platform, running track, towels

If they fire whoever is the maintenance manager and get the cleanliness of the washrooms up to par I would raise this review to a respectable 3 star. LA has some work to do over all if they want to compete with Goodlife and the YMCA.",2,8mLYfBoVymrp7zg2ajRtnw
"This placed seemed dingy and dark. Lights in back were off. Felt like they were closing soon and it was noon. 

Ordered the supreme breakfast burrito. Worst I've ever had. Small in portion, In fact so small it had layers on layers as a result of the tortilla beating out the guts. It also had too much potato. I can only assume cause protein is more expensive than starch. Never again.",1,xMlXVf4JS05i5TlyK2WzeQ
"Total rip off. We were told over the phone that they would waive the $30 consultation fee. They sent a guy over the same day to check out our broken garage door. He was here for 30 seconds and barely looked at it and told us it would be $500 to fix a spring. He called his manager and lowered the price to $375, which is still way too expensive for what needed to be fixed. When we said we would be getting another estimate, he said he wasn't leaving without the $30 consultation fee, despite being told earlier that it was waived. I would never recommend this place, such a scam. Don't know how you can do business this way.",1,Dp0EwXtcTe1NYEdDJgGCUw
"3.5. When we pulled in here to eat, I was almost disappointed bc I thought it would be straight bar fried food. I was so pleasantly surprised that I may have rated it more than it deserved. I got the gyro, which was pretty good. Nothing special. My husband got the pulled pork quesadilla. That was what floored me. It was delicious! I couldn't believe how good it was and I think I still can't! The pork was cooked wonderfully and there was plenty of melty cheese. Well done. We also shared a basket of the loaded fries and those were good as well.

The atmosphere was nice, it was a bar but it was a good size and clean. It wasn't too busy so it wasn't loud which was nice. You could prob do better around that area but since there was a wait at Boneyard this wasn't a bad second choice.",4,G-03iORXZLBxFveXMngvSA
"Another lovely, cheap seafood meal. I got two mackerels grilled and six whitings fried. That was two separate platters. It came with two whole wheat pitas placed under the fish, three whole deep fried pitas, three sides of hummus, and four lemons sliced into halves. I also got 1lb of cold, roasted veggies (zucchini, assorted bell peppers, and eggplant). 

The fish platters cost me just under $20 before tax and the veggies cost me $4 before tax. This was dinner for my parents and me, and we had a whole mackerel, two whiting, assorted pitas, hummus, lemons, and veggies left over. For a dinner that came to about $8/person before tax, that was a lot of food. 

It was also done really well. The mackerel was super juicy and the whiting heads were crispy enough that I basically just ate the entire head without spitting out anything but the eyeballs. Yeah, I'm that kind of person. 

Oh. I also got a mango juice from the drink section right across from the prepared food section. It was $0.99 and tasted like mangoes. I also got a basil seed drink that was quite pink. Rose flavored, supposedly. It tasted exactly the way Vitamin E Body Butter from the Body Shop smells, and has almost an aloe vera juice texture. I quite enjoyed it. It was also $0.99.

For dessert, I picked up a creme brulee for $3.49. My mom has a thing for creme brulee, but it is not cheap, so when I saw this one, I had to get it. It came in a ceramic dish the size of a CD. The ceramic dish was included in that price. The creme brulee custard was super creamy. It also was not too sweet. The sugar crust could have been crispier, but I understand that because it was not made fresh, it is hard to expect much more than what I got. This was a great deal though! I most certainly will get this again.

Adonis is now one of my favorite places to get a seafood meal. Mmmmm.

Side note: I've ordered seafood to be cooked three times now over the last two months or so, and one of the men at the seafood counter recognizes me. He still doesn't know my name, but we can work on that.",4,PkdMykjlGBm0CRVUPo5rvw

"Decent Venue but not the easiest to get to.


Coming from Finch station, take the subway to Bloor Yonge and transfer to the eastbound train to Broadview then take the 504 street car southbound to Queen East and it's about a 5 mins walk from there. 

I went here to see Alvvays for their biggest headlining show in Toronto, a Sold-Out crowd at Opera House. 

The venue is pretty small, and it has a really sketchy grill/restaurant attached if you wanted to get some food before the show. I didn't eat there but the food didn't look too bad.
 
The inside was very clean, and they have multiple bars. 2 on the General Admission floors and one on the balcony. 

The sound was nice, and there were great acoustics. The sightline were also very nice, and you could get a good view of the stage from pretty much anywhere in the venue. 

I sat up in the balcony and had a GREAT view of the stage. The bar was very close to my balcony seat and I had no problem getting a drink. They have a decent selection of beers.

The drinks, like any venue are over priced, I paid $7.25 for a tallboy of PBR.

The washrooms were also well maintained and were located downstairs. They had an attendant which I have NEVER seen. Don't really know why he's there.

Opera House is a great Toronto venue that books some pretty great up and coming bands. It's not the easiest place to get to but not that hard either. 

I would definitely come back if they booked another band I wanted to see.",3,w3b0e6rqt6EILWveJk_wBQ
"Upstream has gone downhill, fast. While the bar ambience and feel is still awesome, the sushi in particular was extremely lacking. Spicy Tuna rolls were not fresh and smelled like fish. California rolls lacked flavor and were quite bland. 

Service was also not particularly good and there was a very creepy manager who put us off. 

It is a shame because Upstream has been a staple of the South Park area for years, but their sushi quality is completely lacking these days. I cannot comment on the main courses as we did not have any.",2,g_0d5jsQZTG9xYmKDXbJlw
"Had the French onion soup that was fantastic, very rich beef broth, crouton and cheese on top. Also had the shrimp and grits. This was cheese grits with bbq shrimp on top. Had arugula and tomato chunks with a Carolina style bbq sauce so you get the vinegar in the sauce. It was really good. I've seen reviews complaining about the price?? You do realize you are in an airport right??? Everything costs more at the airport. Service was also excellent. Not overbearing and not left to fend for yourself. I'll be back.",5,WgSpUAs-w63WscfQOMFkzQ
"I really need to visit and have a sit-down lunch.  I went a week or so ago and ordered at the bar - a cuban for takeout.  The bartender, who was not busy at all, was super un-approachable/unfriendly.  She was polite enough, said the obligatory thanks, etc. but her personality - for a server - really put me off. At any rate, the sandwich was ok, but it was pulled pork (aptly described in the menu) instead of pressed like one normally sees on a Cuban.  Will try Valhalla again, soon and update review.",2,RI3CNwXYHEvtFYzZHeAIuA

"Okay so really the pizza here isn't bad..but it is expensive.  So why not pay a few dollars more and get the truffle since all the pizzas are around the same price.  So I did like that there was a good truffle flavor (I think they toss some truffle oil to enhance the flavor), however there is wayyy too much cheese.  I felt so gross eating, and definitely exceeded by fat content for the week.  If you do decide to try this, I recommend just getting a slice, rather than an entire pizza like we did.",3,DxA5sJoO_QkGXlfficKmOA
"I've been wanting to try this place for restaurant week for years! It was worth the wait. The ambiance is perfect and not too dark, which my boyfriend hates. Our server was energetic and helpful with deciding on the 22 ounce ribeye. We also got the rainbow trout which was phenomenal!! Every bite was delicious from beginning to end. I was brought their signature pecan pie for my birthday dessert, which was a nice surprise. I'm not a fan of pie but it was rather tasty. We will be back! The pricing isn't too bad either!",5,NO98rgvu06yQniYrBjpufA

"I've bee going here for 27 months to receive allergy shots on a weekly basis after my ENT recommended me here. They have multiple doctors who work at this location but I see Dr. Mark Schubert. I hardly ever meet with the doctor even though I am in the office once or twice a week to receive the injections administered by a nurse.

They seem to be helping with my symptoms but beware - at the beginning of this process I was told that I would receive an injection weekly for about a year. After about a year and a half I asked if there was anyway to speed up the process because it was inconvenient going every week and they said that they could split the allergens in to two separate  so that the dosage could be higher. I don't know why this wasn't offered to me as an option at the beginning of my treatment. So since January of this year I have been received two shots, one in each arm, every Tuesday and Friday. Recently, I questioned them about the process again and they said it takes about 3-5 years of weekly injections to build up a good immunity before you can go down to an injection every other week, etc. They said they have patients who have been receiving injections for 20 years!

You have to dedicate about an hour for this process too. When you get there you sign in, wait to have your name called, receive the injection, then have to wait a half hour at the office to make sure you don't have a bad reaction.

I kind of feel like I'm getting scammed since they can bill insurance and/or get a co-pay for every office visit but I still have to get the injections since my allergies are so severe. Know what you're getting yourself in to if you start this regimen and commit to it.",1,GgZZ6cJC9GARY_ExoarLkA

"Scottsdale, in Native American, translates to ""Land of fake boobs and day spas."" You can find both at Hotel Valley Ho. But this review is only for the spa...

If you're looking for a expansive, over-the-top spa, complete with 4 dipping pools, 3 jacuzzis, 2 saunas, and an acre locker room, this isn't the place for you. But if you're looking for a low-key spa with friendly attendants, clean facilities, and a great deal then you should check this out this place.

Facilties: a smallish locker room, 2 showers, 2 full-bathrooms with vanity area, a steamroom, and waiting room. With any treatment of 1 hour or more, you get full access to the fitness room. Complimentary shampoo, conditioner, facewash, lotions are available in the locker room, along with disposable brushes, combs, and razors. While you wait, enjoy some lemon water or Forte tea.

Services: Massages, body treatments, and facials. I opted for the 90-minute Lomi Lomi which included a body scrub and massage.

Value: Comparable to other spas in the Valley. However, they currently have a coupon on their website that gives you $25 off any 60- or 90-minute treatment. They also accept Spa Finder certificates ($100 certificates available at Costco for $80). Combine these things and you can enjoy the 90-minutes of heaven for $160, (20% tip included).

Valet parking available ($12 for overnight guests, free for visitors).",3,3CzieR721ez7ELJ_NoPsag
"Number 1 advice: Go to the pool early. There is a line to actually get into the pool. I believe you have to be in line by 8 if you want a good spot by the pool. Be aware it gets a ton of shade because of the landscaping. 

Beds are comfy maybe too comfy, I didn't want to get up in the morning, that could have also been because of the late night at the hotel bar. The drinks were really good and the bartender was super nice! I really liked all of the staff at this hotel! 

The room was really nice and clean and even had a mini fridge which was great!

I didn't realize how big this hotel was. There are a ton of dining options and shops here. I suggest you get out and explore! It's pretty nice.

Overall my experience was pretty good! I would definitely consider staying at the Flamingo again.",4,5MT5m4f9rB1YjtPgtArcjg
"Pro: food here are decent.

Con: long wait for food even when the restaurant is less than half full, waited 20+ minutes for a medium cook burger.

The soda I order is very watered down.

Also tips are mandatory even when I m in party of 4.  It's not like I m not gonna tip, but feel weird that the server ask me to choose to tip between 3 options, which is 15, 18 or 20%",3,EgSEDhw8s75i8FxsW7wanA

"House hunting and hungry the Copper PP was a great place to take a break and refuel! But a word to the wise.....don't sit to long or you watch the sun set from this pub!

We stopped to catch a quick bite, between lunch and dinner and continue on with our search. Sat outside, enjoyed a beer (many choices) and a couple of salads. Service was prompt and attentive, the salmon salad was fresh, tasty and a generous portion. Lot of space to spread out with an area, much like a back yard for the kids, both young and old, to stretch out. 

If your in the Lake Wylie area you owe it to yourself to give the Copper PP a try!

PS: we so enjoyed our first visit we called friends and to joined us and you guessed it watched the sun set!",4,r3xnNwG_cF9wfdb0vJ-f3w
Purpose of visit: late night dinner after a long transcontinental flight. We we looking for a ramen place and the first stop ramen soba was not open. Anime is open until 12am. Servers we dressed up in anime attire which was interesting.  Ordered two soba bowls with pork and vegetables. Soup was hot and the noodles seemed fresh. Needed a little bit of a kick to spice it up. We also ordered a custom sushi eel roll. The roll was 10 pieces and was very good. This place is a convenient alternative if you are in the mood for noodles. You may even want to take their sumo challenge of eating one of their giant noodle bowls. I wouldn't necessarily make this place a specific destination unless the more traditional noodle shops are closed in the casino.,4,w_2x90XbVcQwqCA4f7SyLA
"Took my crap car, Yelp's own Susan C. and her better half (who has a most impressive Montreal pedigree) out on a Sunday jaunt to the edges of Mississauga for what is generally reputed to be the best smoked meat to be had in Toronto. Well, the GTA.

The Montreal Deli is just west of the 427 and has plenty of parking. That I'm leading with it being conveniently located just beyond an overpass and raving about the parking might not bode well. But it's not that bad.

Smoked meat in Toronto (or Mississauga) is what it is. Depending on your Clintonian definition of what ""is"" is, Montreal Deli is doing its best. Prices are reasonable. The super smoked meat plate (about $11.50) gives you a nice stack of meat, fully acceptable fries, slaw, and a kosher dill. If you think of this as anything *but* a simulacrum of the true Montreal smoked meat experience, well, it's pretty awesome all around.

For purists, I've included in the photo section a photo of the Montreal deli smoked meat super combo and the gold standard of smoked meat, Schwartz's. A keen observer will note the difference in consistency of the meat. The Montreal Deli serves it up almost like a thinly sliced ham. Schwartz's gives you thick rich slices of smoked meat ready to crumble and then melt in your mouth. [Oh god, 2.5 hours until lunch time. - your stomach butting in]

Susan C's better half quibbled with the bread and I defer to his judgment there. I was a suburban boy (a shout out to my homies in Dollard-des-Ormeaux!) Susan's better half is a McGill grad, hence a veteran of smoked meat and it probably goes without saying the Peel pub. From his lack of joyous weeping, I gather he was in the same opinion boat as I.

I'll say this, however, service is fast. I think we had our food in about five minutes. I've waited longer at McDonald's for a McFlurry. 

Bottom line: prices are great, service is fast and great, you get a lot of great food, it's still not real Montreal smoked meat, but give it a try.

(Those without access to a crap car, you can subway it to Kipling, I think jump on the West Mall bus, and then get off before it diverges off Dundas. It's not an unpleasant walk to the Montreal Deli.)",4,hZC7K3u2UFaP9bWTiInVVA

There are some tables to sit at, but you won't stay, unless you're getting snacks to eat.. The place has all the ambiance of an old gas station...

"Pizza is ok- not bad, not outstanding. The same specials in the area are $7.99 and this is $9.99. Maybe it's an extra $2 for grease! The pizza was swimming in it and we used loads of paper towels to soak it up!

"In a way I feel like I should wait before reviewing this place. I stopped in here at about 10:30 on a Friday night, which is right before Sip closes (they technically close at 11, but they stayed open a good 20-30 minutes past that when I was here), but everything was so awesome in that short amount of time that I'm gonna go ahead and give them five stars!

I've been wanting to stop in here for awhile, and too be honest, I've mostly wanted to stop in the morning or afternoon for a coffee and/or food (and I'll be doing that at some point!), but the opportunity presented itself randomly on a Friday night so I stopped in for a couple beers.

I loved the atmosphere. There's lots of space (both indoors & a patio), with comfortable chairs and couches. The staff is extremely friendly & outgoing. Since it was near the end of the night there were only a couple people working, but the guy working behind the bar (I believe his name was Alex...for as much as we talked to him I really should remember) was very outgoing. He seemed to know a lot about both the beers on tap & bottled beers & made my friend I was w/his own whiskey concoction, which she really liked. Speaking of whiskey, I was actually surprised this place even served liquor (I believe they only have whiskey). I just assumed they were beer & wine, but apparently they're not. 

Like I said, I really need to try some other things here to get more of a feel for this place, but I really liked what I saw & tasted in the short amount of time I stopped in for. 

One last thing I should point out that I really like about this place is the hours. I actually LIKE that they close early (compared to bars). They attract a different crowd because of it, and if you're only looking to have a couple drinks it's a good place to start the night or just catch up with friends for a bit.",5,JdrepG4YwHJT55UJ-_NlkQ
"A very impressive meat shop/butcher.  All the usual expected fare plus more German/European specialities.  The extra sundries are basic but varied and cover the major points.

The various sausages I have tried have all been tasty and well made.  The cuts of meat purchased have been lean but still juicy when cooked and don't leave a huge pool of water in the pan like supermarket cuts.

Highly recommend a trip here.  Especially if you have a freezer as they offer freezer packs as well.  The first few times here or if you only visit occasionally will mean you will possibly be leaving with an armload of meat so plan ahead. :)",5,Z0MK1BRP0uECgz-bey6Ffg

"Can I give zero stars? Just came here at 450 pm to get a smog. Hours posted are till 5:30 pm!
Guy with grey hair is sitting on a computer and comes out and says he's closing. Really, that's why you are sitting on a computer and your sign says you're open till 5:30? So you're closing 40 minutes early? Thanks for the inconvenience.....

You're a new business. Keep up that excellent (sarcasm) customer service and you'll be out of business within a year.

Went to Terrible's. No problem. 

Update:
So not only did your employee not honor the posted hours as I outlined in the review, but when this was brought to your attention, you now have passive aggressively resorted to saying I am confusing you with another business. I guess if this was my business, I would also want to deflect the negative yet truthful review! Good luck with that tactic of insinuating your potential customers are senile and demented. I see another poster stated he pulled up during operating hours and had a similar experience but was given a chance to have the test done, granted for ""cash"" since the machine was down before closing time had occurred. Guess people are just pulling these occurrences out of the sky...

No one wants their time wasted. That's why We decided to post the review. I get it. The employee was an older man who wanted to skip out early. Fine. But realize people don't appreciate having their time wasted especially when they are trying to patronize a new business in their community. We have  lived within a 5 mile radius of your Azure location for over 15 years. Believe me we didn't make a mistake!

"Today 7/2/2016 8:30 am time frame visited with very few customers and the staff was untrained and did not know the process of drink refills, food/drink delivery process/timelines, just remembering what we ordered was a challenge, taking the orders was very confused I'm not sure if she was hungover sick or what but it was the worst experience ever the food was cold it was just horrible the entire experience not sure I'm going back after this one. Sad because it's conveniently located.
My husband never complains about bad service or bad food ever ever ever and he verbally let her know how horrible it was it was just horrific disgusting.
He ordered milk with his pancakes that were eaten cold before the milk ever came Our Guest that was with us ordered a muffin that was cold taking back and never brought back it was removed from the ticket, no refill of coffee for a $3 cup, my son and I showed up I ordered a Diet Coke that she couldn't remember and asked me twice what I had ordered to drink which never came I finally cancelled the order and my son and I walked across the street to Sonic and eat there.

They didn't even offer a discount after he complains and he was so upset still and it's now 5:32 this evening and requested me to do it Yelp complaining so there you go I know it's family owned you probably don't care sad because we are really good vocals and know a lot of people and it's not going fly with us and our referral to others",1,xUnaCRtvJ9Ohl2nTY5AGuA
We flew in around 11:30pm and everything was closed.  I couldn't get a water or anything that late.  There were only a few cleaning people and the cop that stands near the exit.  There wasn't much food options or amenities.  It basically looks like a terminal full of seats.  The terminal looks like it might be going through an upgrade.  If not; it really needs an upgrade.  The hill out of the terminal was very steep and I don't think it would even pass an ADA accessible test.  I actually needed a little nudge towards the top of the hill.  The bathrooms were clean and much better than going on a plane.  It's a very long walk between terminals if you have to go.  Also there is no free wifi like most airports.  Lastly; we waited at least 20 minutes for a shuttle to the rental car building.   I really dislike when rental cars are off site.  There were only a couple of buses running that late and they passed us over and over again due to them being full.  I'm not sure if there are other options for airports; so just suck it up buttercup.,2,xaprD0KUPfei8c_ojFc3Xw
"I grew up near Cleveland and this was one of my favorite places to come to as a kid.  After a long hiatus, I've returned recently when I've been visiting my parents in NE Ohio, and it's just as great as I remembered.  

The European cheese shop is probably one of my favorite places at the market; they have a great selection; I always find myself sampling several different cheeses before deciding on two to three to get.  I also really like Theresa's Bakery, Ohio City Pasta, and several of the meat vendors, one of whom makes a great variety of different sausages.

There's always a great atmosphere at West Side Market, too. (Although, I'll admit, I typically go on days one would expect it to be crowded, like the day before Thanksgiving.)  When I'm there, the place is abuzz with activity.

All in all, West Side Market is just a great place.  I currently reside in D.C. and go to Eastern Market often, and, in terms of selection and size, it doesn't hold a candle to West Side Market!

"been here a few times, and this location is a convenient off-the-strip option as far as good, reasonably priced AYCE buffets go.

instead of the usual ""order from the menu"" deal, it literally is a buffet where all the meats, sides, and other dishes like sushi and soup are at a buffet bar. load your plates with your party so you can go back to your table and cook everything family style.

kalbi, bulgogi, spicy pork belly, riblets, brisket. it's all good. the only thing missing is the steamed egg platter more famous at some of the kbbq places i've been to here in so cal. all in all, a great place to enjoy some great food when you're in a good sized party.

"I highly recommend Metro Movers!  The scheduling process was so simple, and Casey explained everything.  She even called the day before the move to confirm everything.  Our movers were on time, courteous, and really great guys.  They made the move simple and no headaches whatsoever....had many of those bad experiences with previous movers.  Everything quoted was exact, no hidden charges.  Will definitely use them again!",5,dEe_JZVaFFZ90sliD-Zygw
"I did buy a car here because I wanted it and because I do try to use my most local dealership when I can, but I cannot say I loved the experience.   

Overall, the problem was with the process.  I liked my salesperson.  Everyone was friendly enough and I have at least some hopes for the service department; however, for a luxury car dealership, the process lacked luxury for sure.  

I went on a whim on a Saturday and test drove one vehicle.  That went fine and was reasonably efficient.  I then wanted to see a more upgraded model before deciding.  That took over an hour, since as a city dealership, they have to go get the car.  The car ran out of gas on the way, so there was that delay as well.  I looked and left, asking the salesperson to provide pricing via e-mail because I was out of time by the time they got the car there.   

There were some wires crossed in the communication, but we eventually all got on the same page and I made an appointment at 9am the following Saturday to show them my trade and complete a cash purchase.  I had already shown my tendency toward impatience on the previous visit.  And I very clearly stated that I didn't want to be there all morning when I made the appointment, so I was hoping that they'd have everything ready except for my trade value.  Not so much.  

The trade evaluation was quick, but then the inefficiency really started.  They didn't have the pricing ready, so there was a wait there.  Then the finance guy was needed (no loan, but he also does title work and the warranty sales spiel ).  He had not a thing prepared either, so I had to wait for him.  Then to the cashier, who had to call and verify my check and issue a receipt - more waiting.  The tech guy who explained all the buttons was next - had to wait for him too.  His spiel needed a little work, but it was good enough.  Then the car needed gassed - again, another wait. 

All told, an efficient process could have easily taken under an hour.  This took over two and a half and that was with me quite impatiently skipping pieces and trying to push it along.  The problem is that their whole process is linear - you are passed from one person to the next with a lot of waiting in between.  Why they can't gas up the car while I am doing the paperwork is beyond me.  Why the tech guy couldn't have done his thing in the 45 minutes I spent waiting for the finance guy is also beyond me.  Why the cashier couldn't have worked on my check while I was doing title work...you get the idea.   

I am sure that people generally spend a ton more time buying a car and perhaps that is normal, but I made an appointment specifically to avoid all of that.  If they are truly serving the luxury market, they need to coordinate the buying process better.",2,T3crlGbbTPjAYc--kZg0jQ
"We went in to see Dr Ceballos for a second opinion on our dog LuLu who has been diagnosed with Valley Fever (Coccidioidomycosis).  This is a fungal disease that is deadly if not caught fast and treated fast and correctly.  After over a week of treatment from our other vet our girl was still lethargic, not eating and had diarrhea.  Dr Ceballos knew immediately what the proper course of treatment should be.  He prescribed some new medicines that she needed to make the other medicine effective and to get her to eat. By the end of that day she was eating again and the following day her energy level was waaaay up.  She will be on treatment for a minimum of six months with this and we will now be seeing Dr Ceballos for her continued treatment.  Let me also say that the front desk staff was amazing.  They were friendly, efficient and caring.  I read a lot of negative reviews about this facility and decided I needed to let people know how happy we have been.",5,2MkRd0ke6yC896zWbQg4hw

"I cannot express enough how truly happy we were to have chosen Ben to do our wedding Fri 2/19/16.  From the very start Ben was very accommodating and seemed all about providing the best customer service and customizing everything for our event ! Well , as the night went ... BEN STILL EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS WE HAD !! 
He made me feel at ease with how the night was going to go ; he worked well with the coordinator ; and when there was chaos , confusion or the party was lacking .... Ben stepped up to help organize the wedding party and even coming  out and dancing ( which we loved seeing ) 
We gave Him a list of music choices and asked him to go off that vibe .... HE NAILED IT !! Every song that came on was a hit. He also was very accommodating to our guests requests. The photo booth rocked and it was nice to get the link to view all the photo booth shots ! If I am in need of DJ ; I'll call Ben again of course . Couldn't be happier !!",5,-aKOR5obfB155KICvuPNDQ

I wouldn't say that it is not family friendly but the reality is that it is a sports bar with numerous TV's, lots of brewchachos's, good food and good service.

"I don't trust them. At first, they seemed great. Then they required me to pay up front for a night guard I needed. It was odd to me that I needed to pay up front, but they wouldn't give it to me without payment. So, I paid. I have two insurances--one did not pay, but the other paid quite a bit. I was told that if insurance covered, they'd put a check in the mail right away. Those were their words. I've seen nothing. I've yet to go in to try to get my money. I'll update when I do. 

The next issue was that my daughter supposedly needed four crowns. She'd been at a pediatric dentist. But she is 17 and he noticed she had one problem area that look like a possible crown and her pediatric dentist felt she was ready to go to a regular dentist. He said her teeth looked great except for that one spot. So, we go to Providence Dental where they tell us she needs at least four crowns and possibly root canals. I tell the dentist that her pediatric dentist didn't say she needed all of that. His response? ""That's why you need to take kids to a real dentist. I wouldn't take my own kids to a pediatric dentist past the age of seven."" So--a pediatric dentist isn't a real dentist? 

When we walked in for one of my daughter's appointments, the gal at the front desk tells me my amount after insurance. It was really high. I was confused but almost paid it, but then I stopped and said, ""Is that with both of our insurances?"" She says, ""Yes, but since you're getting x type (can't remember what it is called) of crowns, your insurance won't cover it."" So, I asked what type of crowns those are. She explains they're a special kind of crown but covered by a warranty, blah blah blah. I tell her no one mentioned those to me before this. Are they mandatory? She says, no they're optional. So, they were trying to upsell me these special crowns without even telling me anything about them before hand. She tells me that they're really great and under warranty so if anything happens they can be fixed or replaced. I tell her I had a crown that fell out once and my insurance fixed it--so why would I pay for an expensive crown that insurance won't cover if I can pay for a normal crown that insurance will cover. She just looked at me. She had no answer. It was ridiculous. 

After that visit, I decided we weren't going back. I started hunting for a new dentist. My husband still planned to continue going to Providence Dental. He had an appointment in December but had to reschedule due to his crazy work schedule. So, he switched it to February. In February, he had to reschedule again. This time he told the lady he just wanted to cancel and would reschedule when things calmed down at work. She was extremely rude to him. She kept pressing him to just reschedule and if he couldn't make it, he could reschedule again. He insisted that he had no idea when to make the appointment because of work and would just feel better making the appointment when he had a better idea of an opening in his schedule. She kept sighing heavily and being snippy with him. So, he's decided he's done there too. 

Two of my kids are still at their pediatric dentist. We've been with that dentist for over a decade. We've never had an issue with the staff, with the dentist or with billing. I wish we could all just see that dentist. Finding a good dentist who isn't just out for the money is really difficult.",1,7Kr5EW7kgr_3KsiJLxqEDw

"My 8 friends and I came here for dumplings, and even though we only stopped for dumplings (I was holding a mini food tour), they quickly set-up a table for all of us in the back. We ordered the pork and chive dumplings fried, and the shrimp and vegetable dumplings boiled (apparently they don't steam them). I expected to hate the boiled dumplings but we actually really enjoyed them. Some people even said that they preferred them over the fried dumplings. That's a first for me! The service was great, and we received our food quickly. I plan to return and try some of their other menu options. They have quite a large menu, and the Schezuan section appealed to several people in my group.",4,oKFtjYFcctVPWXs0RCOUPg
"Came here for a special dinner with the family tonight. Not sure how a fine dining restaurant specializing in grilled meat can screw up twice on my simple rack of lamb. Ordered medium rare, it came out well done. I told the waitress who looked at it and said let me check. She came back and said that the kitchen would make me another quickly. Ok fine, though the rest of my party was almost finished eating their meals. By the time she brought out my new rack, I could already tell something was wrong. I cut into it and not surprised, it was completely raw. When the waitress came back to check on me I showed her the raw meat and she seemed confused and said that yes, I had ordered medium rare. Um, no. The manager came over and offered to have the chef cook it again. By that time everyone was done with their meals so I declined and said I didn't want it anymore. We got 'free' dessert but was annoyed that the manager didn't do more to make it right. No voucher nor discount off our $521 bill. Very disappointed and will not be back again. I guess one good thing was that I was the only one who ordered from the grill tonight.   What a disaster it would have been if we all ordered steaks!  We also ordered a dozen oysters from the raw bar which took over 30 mins to come. We thought they forgot when the waitress started serving our other appetizers without a mention of where the oysters were until we asked when she came back to collect the plates to which she nonchalantly explained that the bar was very busy.  Really? For a dozen oysters? Will not be back again.",1,6058MRTokrb_gZXvnXQvIw
"I have eaten here multiple times and this may be one of my new favorite restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh! The first time we sat at the pizza bar which is a Great place to sit and watch your pizza being made in the wood fire oven! A show must have let out shortly after we arrived because there was a rush of people at the door suddenly and they were telling people it'd be a 45 minute wait! We split the carnivore pizza which was absolutely delicious! Bacon, pepperoni, and sausage- the dough was delicious as well!They have a great craft beer selection, the wine prices seemed to high to me, but everything else seemed priced appropriately. I'd also recommend the Bianca pizza or the Forrest if you are looking for a veggie pizza. I've also eaten here for lunch, which was not as satisfying so the ""star ratings"" are really based on my dinner experiences. I ordered the chicken caprese puccia(balsamic-marinated chicken breast / house-cured black pepper bacon / oven-roasted Roma tomato / house-made basil pesto / house mozzarella) The bread completely overwhelmed the sandwich and when I opened it up to see how big the piece of chicken was it was literally half the size of my palm! I'm a very small person so obviously if it's half the size of my palm I don't even think this constitutes as acceptable on a sandwich. The flavors were good but it was disappointing because of the proportion of bread to meat. I will say,however, that the homemade chips were AMAZING and probably honestly the best I have ever had-and I am NOT a chip person at all! My boyfriend had the soup special (chilled pepper with scallops) and the special for lunch (pork and spaetzle with pancetta). he too commented on the size of his entree which looked more like an appetizer but it was tasty. The soup (besides the chips which again were amazing but that's not a reason to return anywhere) was I think the highlight for both of us. I'll still return but I think for dinner instead of lunch",5,4ZDsCQYD0Kx9jU1v2XI0_Q
"Price is right, but food quality is blahhhhhh.  I succumbed to the TV advertising and went to try again.  I was disappointed.  I got a large 3 topping hand tossed pizza.  Crust was crappy, sauce was crappy, and toppings were OK but sparse.  I would rather pay a higher price and get a better pizza.  I also got  16 piece box of boneless chicken too.  That was pretty horrible -- just dry pieces of breast meat breaded and fried.  Very dry and even though the breading was seasoned, it still was crummy tasting.  I think it would have been better with batter instead of breading.  Oh well, you get what you pay for.  These days, all pizza is not worth the money.  For approximately the same price, you can get a full meal at other restaurants.  The only saving grace to pizza is that it is finger and convenience food. But that is about it.",2,O1sTPScWDSs5tECHOzyuPA
"Not only are the cupcakes amazing but the service is awesome. We went into the store today to pick up dessert for a small family gathering that we were heading to. As always we were running late and in a rush, this led my boyfriend to dropping our box of beautiful cupcakes which quickly got destroyed. After trying to ""put them back together"" we decided that the box was too messy to take the cupcakes in and went back into the store to ask for a different box. The look on his face must have been desperate since the girls not only gave him a new box but gave him new cupcakes all together. We are firm believers of supporting mom & pops shops but with this kind of service it not only makes it easier but a pleasure.

Thanks again!",5,PMGQ7SRxFKUWb9udJPEMmw

I was surprised that they didn't have more beers on tap though.  The food (charcuterie, mussels, and frites) were all pretty good...could use a little improvement in that department but I am sure its a work in progress.  I will def come back soon!!",4,Jyv5LnVv4tCTwYqJPiGgpg

Seriously people, Mood Swings is hella expensive, but Lauren is the best hair stylist/colorist I've had in my LIFE.

"We went to this restaurant expecting Russian and Mediterranean fare so it came as a surprise to find the menu included both American and Mexican at the expense of several dishes we wanted to try.  Since we were the only customers on a Sunday evening, I would hazard a guess that the menu changes are an attempt to attract a wider customer base.  We began with a delicious beet salad that included both cabbage and seasoned carrots followed shortly by varenki, Russian style dumplings generously filled with melt-in-your mouth potatoes and sour cream.  For an entree my wife ordered schnitzel, an Israeli style chicken fillet that had been rolled in panko and fried, adding a small house salad at a nominal cost. I chose beef stroganoff served in a cream and mushroom sauce.  Both entrees included a good sized portion of roasted young potatoes that were delicious.  Unfortunately the entrees were less successfully with the beef being a little too tough and the chicken on the dry side.",3,xcJsTbrprS0zFr3f0uPTvA
Well I don't want to give a bad review since I worked here and the boss isn't so great. I know a lot of the servers there and some are good some still need work. But I know these girls try hard. Well food is good I love there spicy garlic or medium or lemon pepper or salt an vinager wings or even Caribbean jerk is good. Their wraps are good as well and juice steak burger awesome! I didn't like the fish tacos though not good at all. Now I've def had a couple times were the food was not so great but remember its not the server most times its the cooks fault. They are good at having food runners and to run the food asap. So the majority of the time when it takes forever for your food its because of the cooks. Either they are new or someone is training someone or they have a catered event going on or sometimes in all honesty just plain screwing around in the back.

"I got some promo tickets from a promoter in the Quad and went to this show on a whim.  I was not sure about spending $100 on Le Reve in Encore, so this is what we ended up doing.  Let me say this, what a super fun show!  I was laughing so damn hard.  I will say that Frank Marino is really engaging and hilarious.  Just a side note, he talks in rapid fire, stand-up style and throws a lot of show biz references and jokes that some generations/foreigners may not get.  So brush up on your current events and pop stars!  

There are a lot of drag performers performing as stars like: Beyonce, Madonna, Shania Twain, Mariah, Janet Jackson...Cher was prob my personal fav, but all the acts were great.  It is nice that you can sing along and that the audience is so carefree and chill.  There were people of all ages there and the place is so small that you really don't get a bad seat.  I recommend the middle though and not the left and right sides. My upgrade tickets were $20 and drinks were under $10, so this is totally affordable for a show on the strip.

The kinda naked male dancers did the majority of the dancing.  There was one guy who was 2-3 beats off from the rest, but after a while you got used to his dancing being off. lol.

"The one good thing this place has going for it is the beds - super comfy, made it hard to get up from a nap and go out!  Oh, and the rock memorabilia was very cool as well. The room could have been cleaner.  Everything was really dusty, including the items on the snack tray.  We arrived just after 8am on Saturday morning of Fourth of July weekend, and we were pleasantly surprised to get a room right away.  However, the staff wasn't particularly friendly.  Not rude, but just not friendly.  We had breakfast at Mr. Lucky's, then hit the pool.  We went to the Rehab pool first, where we would've had to purchase $100 in food and drinks each to use a lounge chair.  So we wandered to the ""family pool"" where we could occupy lounge chairs without a food/drink minimum.  It was frustrating that they don't allow any outside food or drinks, not even water or gum!  So when we went to the bar to get a beer we would get a cup of ice too, and either let it melt down or fill it at the water fountain near the bathrooms.  Since we weren't staying Sunday night, we weren't given free admission to Rehab on Sunday, which was fine because we didn't really think that would be our scene anyway.

"June was to be my very first experience with Orangutan taking over the service of my contract.  This was the first time Orangutan was to service my system.  

Their Technician, Gabe told my house/pet sitter when my dog growled at him, that if he didn't get that dog away from him, he'd stab it.  This is the caliber of people who are employed by this company and who we as Consumers are entrusting to perform a valuable service and allowing into our homes.  A very scary prospect that someone with a propensity for this type of violence visits homes with pets and children daily.

Each of the 4 Callers who checked up on my service call said they were horrorfied by my account and would have a supervisor call me immediately.  Bill was the only Supervisor I had ever spoken with, but unfortunately due to what may have been a personal emergency was unavailable to follow up with me, but had another Rep call me to see if I would like a return visit since I did not trust the recommendations Gabe made about the potential for a needed repair.  Who would trust anything this individual said?

There were numerous ways this company could have reached out to me and made my first impression a positive one, sadly no one seemed overly eager or interested, so I have to assume this isn't the first time this has happened and it's a usual and customary experience not worthy of their attention.",1,-8L9IWV_V4GRu3W-yHYizg
"Honestly, I am surprised at the number of negative reviews for this place, but it seems that all the newer (2013 start and forward) have been positive, and we have good things to say about it too!  The pork fried rice is amazing and the pot stickers are a new fave also.  I will say that we are not huge fans of the lo mein here, but that is true of all the Chinese restaurants we have tried locally, so it really isn't that big a deal.  

The cashier is the same gentleman each time and each time he is unfailingly nice and smiling.  

Other bonus features: the place is clean, the parking lot is easy to find a spot in, most people are taking to-go orders, so if you want to dine in it's actually pretty quiet, and it's next door to a Starbucks if you want somewhere to relax after in the now cooler air!

Overall: A
We highly recommend the pot stickers and fried rice with any of the meat additions (chicken, pork, beef, etc.)",4,MHdlWX3vBw13zT0JszKaCw
"Don't let looks deceive you. You walk into a small kosher grocery, and in the back is hidden a small, casual restaurant. Their Chinese food is AMAZING! For vegetarians, the Volcano tofu is awesome! I also love a chicken dish with onions in a dark garlic sauce, but don't remember the name of the dish. The chicken meat used in the dishes is moist, tender, and non-fatty. I have been to many restaurants in China, and I like Segal's Chinese food better! :o) The prices are excellent considering the meat is kosher. Great restaurant for non-Jews to try as well; the food tastes better than other non-kosher Chinese restaurants in phoenix.",5,Y69SRhpZMcN7yyhYGMvtag

Took my grandson and my wife out for our monthly visit for burgers and a movie. We also invited his friend and Dad. what a surprise their burger and fries went from $3.99 to a minimum of $6.20 and the ice tea went from $1.00 to $2.49 and no kids menu so our bill literally more than doubled in a month from around $30.00 to over $65.00. This is no longer a good value.  They have lost a regular customer. Besides our income hasn't doubled in the last month.,1,aF-U3ypf6mClUlpDBtXyoQ
"Trust me when they say Kia will show you the power to surprise you with dynamic HIDDEN FEEs and HORRIFYING experiences that go beyond your expectations. Oh they will surprise you alright... Read my story below. 
So I got a new car from this dealership Kia Optima S 2018 (224/227) test driven miles on April 7, 2018. We negotiated a price of approximately 23k for the vehicle and I was very firm on my monthly payments and what I expected to pay the sales person Ian he didn't tell me that it wasn't a firm final offer. So I sign everything and get everything settled and stuff I get called on (04/12/2018) being told the bank won't approve for the length of my term but that I got a lower interest rate and better offer. So this is from TJ finance manager, I get in and guess what? Not the finance manager nor the sales person who sold me the car would speak to me, Chris a person I've never met, tries to negotiate with me and tells me the price is gonna be well over $400 a month I told them this isn't what I negotiated and looking at the total price for 72 months the car comes out to over 30k... that's almost 10k more, how are they going to charge me that much? They didn't even bother explaining anything to me, so I said no, what are my options? he didn't give me any, so I said I had no problem returning the car and going to Honda. Chris says honda won't get me a good deal and they are the worst and I said the worst that can happen is being lied to and you guys did that. So I did what any reasonable person would do... I took my stuff from the car and gave them the keys, and left to Honda. So today, I go and ask for my downpayment check which isn't cut, and Chris had told me he would have it cut, and he says the finance team wasn't there supposedly and they can't cut my check, they want to mail it and I clearly say NO, I need my money. He said Monday the earliest. This the 4th lie from Kia. So now they are giving me the run around. Seriously, stay away from this dealership. Check out the reviews from BBB and online these aren't lies. They are scammers and try to add hidden fees. So if it's possible look elsewhere. Returning the vehicle was the best decision I made in my life. Go to Honda or any dealership, they have Kia's there. If anyone is doubting this I kept copies of everything and I do hope this review helps others to realize that the car they have they can return if you're bullied into a deal you know that you can't afford, you have time to return it, read the fine detail it's there. Please be aware and know it's possible. Take YOUR hard earned money and time elsewhere where they will value you, clearly Kia doesn't. I will be filing a complaint with BBB and the company and leaving reviews on all social platforms. Thanks Kia for allowing me to have the best experience over at Honda 1333 E Camelback Rd and making me realize that Kia isn't worth the time.",1,HY-IeHC86XjGk1dr8gv2TQ

They have a service call button on the table. However, don't expect any waiter/waitress to give you any attention. My friend waved to a waiter. He saw him twice but chose to pretend he didn't see a customer is asking for something.

They only moved very fast when we asked for the bill.",2,Uc_HZdavTrpOmJVe0M40yw
"Amazing customer service. Jesus was informative and patient with my questions both on the phone and in the store. When buying a used phone, he allowed me to thoroughly examine the phone and try it out, which made me feel confident about my purchase. 
Two of us got protective glass on our phones and it went on perfect. 
The prices are very reasonable, and he threw in a phone cover. 
Jesus speaks both english and spanish.

I absolutely recommend this business!",5,MZ87ypvyBLi9BYMgUvLcPA
"I have geico roadside service, contacted them and they told me it would be two hours. Sure I'll wait th at why I pat them, I asked for a motorcycle specific tow truck and off course I got a flatbed truck....they then told me they could only take me to the closest dealership, and anything else would come out of my pocket. .  So I called canceled my roadside service and the tow truck....

The service: contacted hog haulers, super awesome people told me it would take a while because of traffic, they were there in fifteen minutes. Awesome people got me out of the heat  and in the AC filled cabin. They drove me and my baby to my house, again excellent service. We got home and they even took my bike into my garage. I ended calling them and using them once again a week later to move my bike to the shop.

Price: fifty bucks up to 30 miles I think it was, that is amazing and dirt cheap, not only that but they are fully insured and fellow riders heck yeah.

Complaints: they need a fleet of truck and be global all bikers need these people in their life.

Keep the rubber side down!!!

They got a lifelong customers",5,H7E88RL-PfOs6i5Z16Lb2Q
"My wife and I decided to try out the Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill since we are local fans of his.  We were very pleased with Burgr at the Planet Hollywood and figured we would be equally pleased here.  Overall we really wanted to like the place but were disappointed and will not return, especially after the surreal experience towards the end of our stay.

We didn't have to wait to long to get in (30 minutes and my wife won some decent coin on the slots beforehand).  Our server was not very knowledgeable about the beer selection or other items on the menu (as we were about to find out).  My wife wanted to get a beer comparable to Stella Artois (something we could justify spending $10 on) but the server could not help us identify a similar beer since we were unfamiliar with some of the brands and figured he was.  We ended up ordering sodas and water instead.  Probably a wise choice considering the cost.

I ordered the bangers and mash and my wife ordered the onion soup and the mac and cheese.  I enjoyed the sausage links (made in-house) but felt the potatoes were a bit overdone with cream and butter.  My wife liked the onion soup but felt that there was only one tiny slice of french bread on the top and not the normal amount of bread usually served with this soup.  The taste of the mac and cheese was pretty good yet the noodles were very underdone.  They were about 3-4 minutes away from being al dente.  When my wife brought this up to our server (she has professional kitchen and culinary training), he said ""yes, the noodles are supposed to be al dente"", and that was it.  It was a weird exchange.  It was too bad the noodles were too gummy because the rest of it was pretty tasty.

I had never had rhubarb before, so my wife ordered the rhubarb cobbler from the menu.  After about 15 minutes, our server came to us and said the item had been 86'd from the menu but they were making some more ""downstairs"".  My wife (a former employee of Caesars/Harrahs) asked about the other desserts and found that they come from the downstairs bakery that provides pastries for other eateries in the casino.  We were very disappointed with this news.  The desserts might be Ramsay's recipes or they might not be (it wasn't clear to us), but the fact that they were being mass-produced in the downstairs bakery rather than in-house upset us a little.  Nothing against the people who work in the bakery at Caesar's (they make some delicious pastry), but for a fine dining experience you would expect to get your dessert made in house at the prices being charged.  After 15 more minutes they delivered the cobbler, yet the cobbler they delivered was a peach cobbler.  She again notified our server, and this is where it got bizarre.  He argued that it was indeed rhubarb (a different kind of rhubarb at that) mixed with other fruits.  My wife was flabbergasted, as was I.  She knows the difference between a rhubarb and a peach and was offended that our server tried to convince us otherwise.  I have no experience with rhubarb myself, yet I know it is reddish-purple because I see it at the store.  I also know what a peach looks like, and it looked and tasted exactly like the fruit that was in the cobbler.  There wasn't a shred of red or purple anywhere in that cobbler, just straight up yellow.  After we left, I looked up a picture of rhubarb cobbler and it was bright red and purple.  We sent the cobbler back and they did not charge us for it.  Afterwards the manager came to us and apologized for the mix-up, yet still carried the viewpoint that it was a different kind of rhubarb.  I mean, enough already.  It was peach.  End of story.  

Long story short we wanted to like the place, but were disappointed and slightly offended that they kind of thought we were dum-dums in the great rhubarb/peach debate.  Good thing Gordon Ramsay has a good burger place in town to fall back on.",3,Z8qcl38HguuAXRs34K1kSg

"I""m not sure if Roy A. was referring to the Bloor Park GoodLife club or this Manulife Centre club (they are only a couple of blocks from each other) but unless they changed the rules, this club does not have mandatory towel service but the other one does.  This is one of the older GoodLife clubs but it was renovated several years ago (I can't remember the exact time frame as I was a member of Bally Fitness back then) but I want to say 2004-2005.

The club is located on the second level offices opposite the theatres and the layout is a bit odd as it seems like everything was shoe horned to fit some leftover space.  This location has a swimming pool though many may challenge that definition and call it an oversized bathtub.  It is unique for any gym in the downtown to offer a pool and it uses salt water.

The facility is small and there is minimal equipment so expect to share often working in while you're resting between sets.  You need to pass through an open concept spinning room to get to a weights area and the aerobics room in the far back of the gym.  The older gym had old carpeting and the update has certainly helped.  I use this club when i'm in the area so it's my second most used gym outside of my home club.

The trainers and members seem pretty nice here bit I'm not familiar with any of the instructors in these classes.  Despite it's small size, it has enough equipment to get a short workout in without any major issues.The space is tight between the equipment and some of them are older.  Will not accommodate many members and has shorter hours than most other GoodLife clubs.  Overall, I'll rate it as a 3 star facility.",4,9vnakgxMalEwFtHcblbgrg

"What a joke this place is. After a long boycott of this establishment by myself because of how they handled their grand opening food giveaway, I finally decided, WTH let's give them a shot. Unfortunately, I should have held tight with the boycott. I walk in at lunchtime and there is just one table with any patrons at it, and they were served right after I ordered, so I figured my wait shouldn't be long. Wrong... apparently it's takes way more time than I realized to cook a burger that is the size of a quarter. And even though they are tiny little pucks of meat, they are priced like a regular sized burger. And none of that would have drawn my ire had they simply made my one teeny, tiny burger as I had ask them to, which they did not. Not even close. And when I called to let them know how they goofed, I didn't receive an apology, but rather was told to come back for the correct burger. Yeah, I'll pass on that. But if you enjoy paying more for itty bitty portions and subpar customer service, this is the place for you.",1,C1WNdI69PIBvqlMigwkaZw

"My stylist is Danielle. The first time I went, I scheduled an appointment a week in advance. I was scheduled to get a pixie cut... it was completely out of the ordinary for me and quite a scary idea that I'm gonna have short hair, but I wanted to do it. I felt uncomfortable because I didn't know how I'd look with short hair, so Danielle let me get my cut in one of the rooms in private. She made me feel completely comfortable. She also gave me the cutest cut ever and I felt very fierce after. I get tons of compliments on my hair everyday, so for that I thank Danielle. Second time I wanted to get a trim, I just texted her and she was quick, I got an appointment that day, and she gave the cutest trim ever! It was better than the first. I honestly love her, she's amazing with a straight edge! 

I'm going to go back soon for a trim, and would also like to dye my black hair to platinum blonde, so let's see what happens.

"I had a custom hockey jersey framed and both of the guys I worked with were extremely helpful. The jersey came at high stakes as it was a jersey gifted to the CEO of my company and he wanted it framed. The guys were very helpful and understanding that this needed to be PERFECT. 

Allen called me half-way through the process to see exactly how I wanted to move forward because our original layout didn't end up working. He sent me pictures of my options so I didn't have to make the drive all the way there, which was nice. 

It did take a while to get the jersey framed though, but it was the holidays so I'm sure that played a factor. I didn't have a time crunch so it wasn't a big deal. 

I'm so happy I chose these guys rather than any of the other frame companies I looked into originally.",5,TTfrlKYHMLLynnHBH1ybLA

"Once upon a time, I would bring everyone I knew to this restaruant for a fun-time and good brunch. Now, I never suggest it and refuse to step foot in again. 

The atmosphere is sort of fun-loving with a cute minibar at the front of the restaurant and seating arrangements spanning from patio, main floor and second floor. 

The service is almost non-existant...You have a server appear once and then never again. You are perched or famished or something but no one is in sight...You can hear staff laughter or see them sipping on a beverage while you try to control your own thirst for water or coffee or tea. If you have a table to wait on, why are you not doing so? Of course, I am not suggesting to constantly be on the lookout for what to do for your customers but some semblance of thoughtfulness of bringing over the menu or a glass of water really goes a long way!

The food is inedible. My go to was always the Blueberry Hill. However...Once it was slightly burned which I excused and simply ate. The second time was completely burned. Each pancake was covered in burnt pieces of dough...There was an attempt to conceal it with more blueberry compote but failed miserably. I had asked to replace it and was denied. This ties back to the notion that customers are not the priority here but rather maintaining a relaxed attitude is. Again all we diners ask is that our food is cooked well (or even decently or maybe even considered edible) because we pay for your services and your food. You hurt your customer's trust in your product by displaying certain things and frankly, this is not my recommended anything anymore.",1,fRvkoFPYP7CtHOMbl_mMuw
"So, as much as I like to think of myself as pretty put together, try to be hip and cool, but when it comes to make up, I am a real make up virgin. Okay, perhaps not a virgin per say, but a novice, a newbie, perhaps a beginner wanting to migrate to intermediate. Primers, different brushes for different areas, strobe, pinch pots, bb creme vs foundation, wth? 
I'm pretty simple with the whole make up game, but do occasionally fantasize that I could put on make up and not look a french prostitute, and even though the talented make up artists at Mac know a thing or two about beautifying oneself through make up application, I often don't love the finished look of my painted up face. I must say though this last time, Christina was very skilled in the whole make up process. 
Having brought a friend in who is newly divorced and even less adept in make up than myself, I was so excited to see her all gussied up, fake lashes and all. 
I purchased a few items, will try them out, and as they say, practice makes perfect. 
Mac is a little pricey, but I do think some of their products are worth it. I have read they don't test on animals anymore, which is a good thing, I try to only buy products from companies that don't. Testing on furry friends is not cool. 
Have been to this location a few times, would return again when I need more.",5,PYhJvTA3Vb6tuUEic_wjCQ

"It was a quiet weekday when we arrived for a late lunch.  We were seated promptly and our waitress arrived without delay and was pleasant.  We ordered a serving of 4 of the vegetable egg rolls, and for the main course we opted for the crispy honey chicken with a side of brown rice.  The waitress arrived with 2 egg rolls but we told her not to bother to go back to the kitchen for the remaining order.  Glad we did because the egg rolls tasted stale as though they sat around for a week and were reheated for serving.  The dipping sauce was a spicy chili sauce and it was terrific, especially in offsetting the stale flavor of the egg rolls.  The main course of honey chicken itself was tender and had no grizzle.  However the dish lacked any flavor whatsoever.  There was a sparing amount of glaze on the plate which accompanied the chicken but it too didn't add much taste to the dish.  I wouldn't order the egg rolls and the honey chicken again.  The big surprise was the brown rice.  It was awesome.  It was tender and cooked to perfection.  Last but not least: I found their dinner napkins to have an odd and offensive smell as though they sat around in some grimy old closet for years.

In order to avoid the line up, we went to there at 6ish.  Still have lined up when we arrived!  After 20 mins wait, we got seated.  Gordon Ramsay posters and TVs are at every corner.

The music and background was so loud! May be we're too old for that... so we only ordered 2 burgers, finished and left right the way!

Mushroom burger -  the mushrooms were so favorable and patty was cooked medium rare.  The meat still juicy inside and the bun was fresh! Hell's kitchen burger - avocado, oven roasted tomato and medium patty also cooked perfectly.

I have been to the Pita Jungle in Chandler many times and loved it.  I love the Lentil Fetoosh Salad.  Tried the one in Gilbert and have to say was disappointed some.  Got the cheese and fruit platter and was served with molded cheese which makes me wonder about the quality at this location.  Server picked off the molded cheese and said is that good.  Also had the quesadilla which was excellent.  Service was good although the plentiful staff just sat around and watched you eat.

"Our server Tyler S was very knowledgeable, friendly, and patient. He was also honest about the food. The manager came around and checked on us which was nice. Service was fast. 

THE FOOD: amazing. We started with 2 short rib tacos, Mac & cheese, and for our entree, we split the chili relleno. 
All of the food was flavorful and delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about my meal. The Margaritas could easily be on someone's top 5 list. 


We ended our evening with the bread pudding skillet. This could have been a little sweeter, thankfully the scoop of ice cream helped that. Perhaps a bit of honey on top or agave would be a nice touch to that dish. I would order it again though despite it not being as sweet as I personally like.",4,tvK-tpLoUx0mkw2AtU2P5w

I got mine with bulgogi (the best seasoned beef), purple rice, tons of veggies (like corn, spinach, broccoli, spices, and fried egg all served in a hot stone bowl.

Great selection of food on their menu and their from their specials.  Kids eat free on Mondays and Wednesdays, too!  The food was excellent, and the prices are great!!  Beef tips on rice with 2 sides and a roll was $7.95!!  The staff was also very friendly...our server was great and very attentive.  We will definitely frequent Phat Daddy's for lunch and dinner...and I can't wait to try breakfast, too.",5,UN6IQwLyTYJvSY2LC0jbfw
"One of the most underrated taco shops in the valley! Great tacos, sauces, prices, and atmosphere! Encourage all to come and visit. Couldn't be more satisfied with the food also the staff and the two beautiful ladies who helped us! 

Also if it's your first time you can try the meats for Free and taste what you want cause they do have variety! 

Thanks Most Wanted Taco Shop!!!!",5,osiNboMUlVPAHu3QUKI1gA
"This airport is pretty basic, nothing really special about it. It is clean and well maintained. I like the walking escalator. My complain is that it takes forever to reach a bathroom & there's only 3 bathrooms !! The line for customs is even longer. They seem to have changed the baggage claim area or maybe I was just too tired. Everyone was just in one area & it was super crowded ! Coming at night, there isn't much staff on the floor ! Plus, I didn't find much option for food so I suggest eating before getting there . The good thing is that there's plenty of buses/shuttles that can pick you up from that location.",3,LvE8ZKHJDCnUwPVvU7EjiA
Went to this place for breakfast whilst visiting Toronto and enjoyed it so much I went back a couple days later to their other location! This location is the better one though so I recommend coming here. I had the croque monsieur and my boyfriend had the savory pancake. Both were very good. The second time we went back we just went for dessert and tried one of the signature waffle which was very good. I wish they opened a store in LA because I would definitely go regularly!,4,ehnQDUpGPocXCGkY39gFOQ
"The best jerk chicken meal ever! The perfect blend of spice and juiciness. We order ours with a side of their pasta salad. Perfect balance with the chicken. The restaurant doesn't have a menu or anything inside so the first time we went we had to check the website to see what they have which is the only reason I'm giving 4 stars, but this has become our go to place to grab jerk chicken whenever we are craving it and we don't even live close by, but it is definitely worth the trip!",5,0VBRW6do93dizS1aHGjTBg
"10/29/11 DINNER.

Mixed emotions on this one. Came hoping to love, left a little disappointed.

ME: Linguine w/ triple cream brie w/ toasted walnuts, mushrooms, prosciutto, fresh herbs & Parmesan. Added chicken for $3 more, per waiter's suggestion. There was brie, even some chunks, but it wasn't very strong, in aroma or flavor. (When I drank a sip of Point Noir with a bite, that seemed to bring out the brie.) There were absolutely no mushrooms, which were greatly missed in this dish. And there was hardly any prosciutto, again, missed. Basically I ended up with walnuts & chicken in linguine in a creamy cheese sauce. And I didn't need the chicken after all, I think the dish would've been better without it. Overall, an OK dish, but not as interesting since it didn't follow the menu description. (FOLLOWUP: I had some left over the next day, and it actually improved in brie flavor having set overnight in the fridge.)

SPOUSE: Filet Oscar, which was  the classic filet of beef topped w/ king crab and Bearnaise sauce, w/ asparagus, then drizzled w/ Cabernet sauce, all on top of leek mashed potatoes. OK, there was a POOL of Cabernet sauce, and hardly any Bearnaise. The beef was good, for a filet, and exactly as ordered, rare. But for the money spent, spouse wasn't thrilled. Good, not great. His meal did come with choice of a salad or soup, he chose butternut squash soup, which was good, tasted more like pumpkin, earthy & sweet.

DESSERT: We split the pear dessert, which was again good, not great. We also split a glass of Chilean dessert sauvignon blanc, which the waiter brought in separate glasses, a nice touch. The wine was recommendable: fruity, aromatic, not too sweet.

WINES: All we drank were wines-by-the-glass. It was nice to find a Patricia Green Pinot Noir on a by-the-glass list. The cheaper-line-by-Schraumsberg Mirabelle sparkling rose was better than I had expected. (LONG time ago, I had tried Mirabelle Brut and thought it smelled/tasted like bug spray! Obviously Schramsberg has improved the wines on their secondary program!) And the nebbiolo was fine. But the bill for 4 glasses of wine skyrocketed the cost of our experience.

SERVICE/VENUE: Attentive, nice waiter. Nice setting. (We had to sit outside, cuz it was crazy full inside, but the heater sufficed for the outdoors at night.)

OVERALL: If we had not had our $50 Groupon with us, we would've paid $170+ for this meal, which I found rather crazy. I'm glad I finally tried Grape Street, but I won't go outta my way to return.

PS: I wish we could have tried the food at Nora's Wine Bar, which closed recently. The only day we visited, we only got to do wines. THAT menu looked incredible, authentic Italy Italian, AND they had a fantastic selection of wines by the glass as well. Sigh.",3,Guat5EzFEPmEhndp2XU1TQ

"I just love coming here when I am in Scottsdale!  Prefer to sit outside on their terrace that overlooks the city in the evening when they have their fire pits going.  Just a few cocktails and an appetizer or two can set you back some bucks but hey, every once in a while you got to treat yourself!",4,NUhA01gG0qM4EtOH7mdBUw
Very good. Menu has changed over time. Last time I went I'd have given it a 5star. Now it's a 4. Either way it's great French food.  Not bad price compared to other French places on the strip.,4,eFqwmevFQgXfMTIhmuG0cQ
"Good, but not great...

Sloppiness in the kitchen prevented this from being a better review than it is, but if the kitchen can make mistakes like these, I have serious questions about how good they are.

We all had salads for our first course:
 - The Caesar was enough for two, but the dressing was boring to say the least.  No brightness of any sort.
 - The baby beets were good, though again the dressing was much understated - that is to say, mostly olive oil.
 - The arugula was fine, but again nothing special.
 - The roasted red peppers were fine, though oily.

As for mains:
 - The New York strip was cooked perfectly, but was served a little above room temperature.  I would have sent it back, but figured that if I did so, I'd be getting my steak while everyone else was having dessert.
 - The filet we had at the table was excellent.  However, the portion was huge.
 - The flat iron steak was a bit small and not cooked medium well as requested, but the taste was excellent.
 - The grilled salmon was cooked properly and was deemed to be wonderful.

Sides:
 - Asparagus - grilled to death and greasy  - uck!
 - Brussels Sprouts - what can you say about food cooked with bacon - yummy - if not a bit greasy.  (We ate all of them.)
 - Potatoes - we ordered Fingerlings but got whipped Yukon Gold.  (We didn't request a change since it was not worth worrying about.)  The whipped potatoes had enough butter and cream in them to clog the arteries of the people at the table next to ours.  Consistency was a bit too much like baby food for us, but they were very good.

Desserts:
 - Ice cream - not much to say about that
 - Monkey bread - very good, but very rich
 - Banana brioche bread pudding - okay - I'm still waiting for the taste of the banana.

For the price of the meal, the portions were very generous.  All of the sides were big enough for generous helpings for two or three people.  However, the fact that the kitchen sent out a cold steak and grossly overcooked asparagus gives me more than ample cause for concern.

All of the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.

All-in-all, a very good value for the money, but the kitchen needs to clean up their act.  I would give them a second chance, but having been to other steak houses in Vegas, it would be a hard sell, since we know of better choices with more professional kitchens and exceptional service.",3,c3KqtDhaGe-_HVcrFnTyGg
"Oh my goodness, this place is the BOMB! Pricey, but so delicious. I love that they offer samples. Would be awesome if you could buy a single cupcake though. Great for special occasions. The cake is rich and moist. Just how I like cake! GO!",5,xuNSQJT9yLZ_S-iVrjtZkw

"My family really enjoys the food at IKEA ! My husband appreciates the value! We have a wonderful meal that doesn't break the bank and we then can finish the evening with some really fun shopping.

"I am not a big yelp review writer, but the bald manager at this place was arguing with customers on the drinks they wanted to order, and telling them that what they wanted was wrong. I get that there's a way you need to order based on the menu but you don't have to be rude about it. He argued with the girl in front of me for 4 minutes, and told the girl behind me what she should order after she ordered then told her he could make what she wanted. I felt offended for them.",1,VgdLr9o_0QPfms8WBkDKeg

"Stopped by to have an acai bowl. It was pretty good but overpriced for the size it was. Was $10. Very small compared to other places. I wouldn't come back, I suggest you go somewhere else where you can get more for your money. Other than that, the store was adorable and had cute nick nacks. Would probably try a smoothie there.",3,ckDrdSr5fu26pP_jqFlj1g
"My airline is a corporate sponsor, so I get 2 for 1 tickets.  Yay!  I like this venue, but I don't love it.  This was my third time here.  I was exhausted by about Floor 3.  There are some cool displays and some interesting information, but I don't think I would have been too thrilled to have paid full price.  The best part is the Induction section.  Huge screens with videos highlighting inductions over the years.  It is long.  But you get to sit down.  After walking around the museum for about three hours, it felt good to do so.  Parking is $8 in the lot to the east of the museum, close to the lake.  It was the cheapest lot we found.  The thing that bothers me about this museum is the music competing with other music.  For example, the Beatles section is close to the Rolling Stones section, but you can't really appreciate the background music playing for either one, since you hear pieces of ""Love Me Do"" when you are trying to appreciate ""Satisfaction"".  The costumes on display are another great section of the museum.  I loved that part.  It gets a little crowded on the weekends, so try to go during the week if you can.  I will probably return again if I have friends from out of town visiting, but I am happy I don't have to pay full price.",4,fllGSZbE7L82zOL__IX3Hw
"Dessert craving satisfied! Came by on a Sunday around 4:30 looking to sit down and catch up with a friend. Luckily there were spots available both in parking (big plaza with tons of food shops) and inside. Ordered a mango bingsu and chocolate waterfall (ice cream & toast), which were 11.99 each. Interesting that I asked the staff for recommendations but they just directed me towards the menu....haha

The bingsu was definitely my favourite among the two. The mango was diced into small pieces that made it easy to enjoy with the shaved ice. Did not have as much of the chocolate waterfall, but the toast was nice and crunchy. The menu is a bit small but they have all the common bingsu options (e.g. matcha, mango, strawberry, five cereal) and similar flavors for their ""waterfall"". Definitely stacks up among all the other dessert shops in that plaza and nearby!",4,bSEHXTiEblF8l-kSVVfEYQ
"i really hate to give one star, but ""i've had better"" doesn't express  that i only ate some because i was desperately hungry and eager to keep shopping, and i left more than two thirds of the mountain of grub on my plate.   i would say it was barely edible, and i was a little worried that it would make me feel sick later.  but it only repeated on me a little.

the egg roll was greasy and had a chemical aftertaste.  it was soggy inside and looked refried.   the salad was nice, and the vegetables seemed fresh enough, nice dressing.   the pad thai was wet and sticky, and the vegetables were mangled, and grey. and frantically hot like something that was microwaved.  the tofu was good.

the service was very good.  so i gave a decent tip, but then 13 dollars for a dozen mouthfuls of soggy goop was just too much.",2,CSbxo25u5W1ixhcXAVkwvg
"So this is the Campus ""Club"" for faculty and staff where you must purchase a membership to dine here or pay extra. Been here a few times for work lunches and thought the food was mediocre at best.

My latest experience here was on Tuesday for the Holiday Buffet which cost roughly $30/person for lunch and the best dish they had there was cocktail shrimp (I believe that says a lot regarding the quality of this establishment). There was a salad bar with not only salad but quinoa (pretty good) and veggies. They also offered salmon which was cold, tasteless, dry, as well as pork, steak, turkey which happen to all be tasteless and chewy. Dessert bar was cookies that looked like they were from Costco (which might be better since they're chewy), some tarts and a holiday dessert. 

They opened the window to the room which held all the food and it was pretty chilly on Tuesday so obviously there will be a draft which will cause the food to be cold even if you place it under a heat lamp/warming tray - go figure.

Service here is meh. It's like the judge you whether or not you have an actual membership or a guest pass (which we had). I enjoy the dinning rooms as they are very Victorian-esque atmosphere. Overall, I could not justify spending $53 on a lunch buffet and a glass of cab-sav wine.. I could have gotten an actual good meal elsewhere on campus like poutine and for a fraction of that price.",3,3OJzi409N0KH0IUc4gtfTw
"The biggest issue is that the food certainly is not fresh. Plus, there is too much of sodium and MSG. Enough, to upset your stomach.

"I love sprouts, but this Sprouts had a very sad selection of vegetable, a lot of the fruits and veggies we're going bad or bad already. I was super disappointed and I will try to avoid this location when looking for fresh produce.

"Food wasn't necessarily bad, but was really quite bland. We had the cashew chicken and the spicy beef with broccoli dinner combinations and had to add some of our own seasonings for flavor. Unfortunately this was the case also for the spicy beef dinner. Not a likely repeat.",2,yEfJsFOBiGi3DXtDStYE-A
Love this place not just for kids but also me as an adult. Obviously not too many places on the strip cater to the youngens but families do exist in LV so its a cool alternative to chuck e cheese's ( hate that place). Skee ball is the ish! And there are carnival style games there too. Dairy Queen inside as well and restrooms are well kept. Prize section has good variety even for not a lot of tix. Recommend this place if you are in Vegas with the lil ones.,5,pkwNsp1Dx-uYd1IfSntXIg
"My boyfriend took me to The Elm Tree Restaurant for dinner. The atmosphere is romantic and classy. Service was excellent - a server would bring out our meals, then our main server came over to tell us the dish ingredients, cooking style etc.

DRINKS:
Sauvignon Blanc, Eradus (for me) - more on the sweeter end, which I preferred. 
Pinot Grigio, Serenissima (bf)

APPETIZERS:
PAN SEARED SCALLOPS (3/5)
(Seasoned with curry salt, green apple purée)
The scallops were seared perfectly - very delicious. Unfortunately, I didn't think the green apple purée was a good match with the scallops.l, it was too sour. 3 points goes to the scallops though!

MAINS:
DUCK CONFIT (4/5)
(With wild mushroom risotto)
Mm the duck confit was delish! The skin was very crispy with just the right amount of fatty and duck meat. The mushroom risotto was also great - it gets salty after a while but still a great mix with the duck leg. 

PAN SEARED CHILEAN SEA BASS (4/5)
(Saffron infused rice, caper meuniere sauce, diced tomato)
For those who would like something more healthy tasting, this is a good choice. A very light dish - the sea bass was tasty and fresh. I enjoyed this dish very much. 

DESSERT: 
TOFFEE CAKE (5/5) 
You would be missing out if you didn't save room for this dessert!! I looooved this toffee cake. So good - there was a crunchy glazed toffee on top of the vanilla ice cream and the toffee cake is at the bottom. I would come back again just to order this dessert. So so yummy, great end to our meal! :)",4,AtZwhwB79iedw-C2NNDwFA
"Love this place. They have a nice size menus with a variety of options. Nothing is more than $8.95 regardless of what entire you get. I love the chicken karee which is a yellow curry sauce with chicken breast, cashews, cilantro, onions and potatoes served with a nice size portion of rice. Add the roti bread with it for $1. Great satisfying meal. As I have read comments regarding portion sizes, I must disagree. It's curry. You do not want to over due it. I feel they give you good size portions. Everything is made to order so the food comes piping hot. My sauce has always been the right thickness. My only issue is I think the roti bread should come with the meals and not be added on. But it's worth the extra $1. Amazing bread. Highly recommended place. Even for vegetarians and vegans.",4,bPsXVWHCGbmNi87R8ZX7Qg
I had the pan pizza with sausage and it was soggy the dough was almost soupy. We also got an italian beef and it was bland. We didn't eat any of our food and just made something at home. We will not be eating there again.,1,2zshIgXQ0tk0UJ5aPfIgdg
"Ate there for the first time 1/10/17 for dinner.  The service was phenomenal and the food was delicious!  We had the Thai iced tea, spring rolls, hell curry, and cashew tofu. All delicious! Great atmosphere - pretty decor and live music. The prices were also very reasonable.  Would like to return to try more of the menu.",5,f5V8qCdAM_-Yl-ohgSxMvA
"Avoid coming here. Poor ramen and poor sushi! Thought we'd give this place a try because it was conveniently located in the mall. The prices are high but we figured it's gonna be worth it. Yikes! We were wrong. The soup is pretty tasteless, nothing like real milky pork broth like Kinton on Baldwin or even NYC's Ippudo. I had to douse my ramen with chili seasoning to add more taste. The sushi is also abysmal. Giant in size so lacks finesse of true sushi, the quality of fish was also subpar. We just didn't finish it because it was so bad. The service is spotty, ramen came fast and the sushi came a good 20 mins after which left for a disjointed meal. $50 for 2 ramen, 1 roll and a pop. I'm never coming again....",1,0lNz7378amJhpLMHFHQuMQ
"Please bring back the Scottsdale Burrito! The jive omelette was bland. Literally smothered it with hot sauce to finish. This is our favorite breakfast joint, but missing the old menu terribly.

"I am always on a quest to find great soul food joints here in Vegas and this place might possibly be my new favorite thanks to the goddess Kathy and her heavenly cuisine. I swear I feel like I have stumbled into my mother's kitchen every time I eat here. Some of the best soul food I have had in a very long time. 

The space is very small but the food makes up for it in authenticity, flavor and taste. I can't say enough about the Seafood Plate!! It is a platter with all the fixing's from ettouffe, fried catfish, crab and shrimp...a must have on every visit. The cornbread is always cooked to perfection, the cabbage and black-eyed peas sides make me feel like I have been tossed into the back woods of Louisiana somewhere. The smothered pork chops with a side of mac n' cheese is another favorite. The meat literally falls off the bone and that is seriously all I ever leave on the plate afterward.....the bone! Don't forget accompany your meal with a glass of sweet tea! So much good food and because now that I have adopted Kathy as my second mother, I will be back!",5,dshPRG9CEZTRnrJVgXjURQ
"1st time to Canes.  Food decent, service is better than most.  Person who took my order called me buddy 4 times.  Im old school retail, what happened to sir or mam?  Im not your buddy.  Im your employer.  Buddy is way too informal.

Music really loud inside.  Person who brought my food out had to shout over the stereo.

Employees having a party in the front laughing and goofing off to add to the noise

When I went to sit there were 8 dirty tables waiting to be cleaned.  Hard to find a clean seat.

Canes is ok.  I might come back, but not for a while.  There is nothing special here.",2,7BO8UhuzN7Aqw2pQDI8tQQ

$26.99 for a weekday dinner AYCE

Went here for a friend's birthday. The menu had a wide variety of selection in Japanese and Thai cuisines. Fast, friendly service. And very tasty food.

"It's easy to fall in love with Tacos El Gordo... the smell of grilled carne asada as you walk from the parking lot to the door, the hole-in-the-wall atmosphere, the amazing tacos... Yeah, I've fallen for this place just like many others have. Even though part of my heart still belongs to my first (taco) love, Los Parados. But, that place is long gone and I'm just glad I finally have El Gordo to fill the void.

The adobada tacos ($2 ea.) are every bit as good as everyone says they are. The best part of the pork were the pieces carved from the exterior of the pork on a spit. They had an amazing crispy, charred edge to it that added to the transcendent flavor and texture combinations of the tacos.

And, don't forget about the carne asada tacos ($2 ea.). They're some of the best I've had in town. The quality of the beef was outstanding. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the slimy green faux-guac sauce covering the meat. Next time I'll just have to get the tacos plain, with nothing but onions and cilantro.

Everyone seems to love this place, as evidenced by the long lines that snaked through the restaurant during the peak lunch time. So, whether or not you love tacos or are a taco virgin, stop by Tacos El Gordo and you'll be enthralled too.",4,woawcrwcDkH4seUdEDOhHw
I have been a customer with Carmel Cleaners for 2 years now ever since I moved to Scottsdale. There is a reason why they are award winning and have consistent amazing reviews. Every single one of the staff greets me with a genuine smile and hello every time I come in.  I went to go pick up my tuxedo yesterday at 6pm for my wedding today in Chicago and had forgot the summer hours close earlier! Any other facility I would be doomed but Kim took time out of her own morning to meet me at 530am and it get it to me! Can't express how much I appreciate this place!,5,sxze2l7eH9TVNpKoLDM3sA
"I am in love with this concept! What I'm even more enamored with is the 3 min walk it takes me to get here... holla holla! 

I went for the Grand Opening last night and was super excited to try all of these unique restaurants with inspiring flair on the standard dishes we know and love.

Summary:

The Rice Shop (essentially like a Poke place - but they did have a delicious looking chicken bowl with broccoli and rice. That's the one I'd grab since I'm not huge on the raw fish movement lol)

Tin Man (I think the vibe here is like... an All American experience. They have a DELICIOUS burger, onion straws, chicken and dumplings, pot roast, apple inspired dishes and desserts) 

Sauce The City (to DIE for crispy deep fried chicken with a bounty of flavorful sauces - Homestyle, Cleveland Hot and Sauce Fire Hot - which I can only imagine how intense that one is as I smelled the heat coming off a plate that passed by me. They have a fun spin on fire roasted corn on the cob and of COURSE, Sweet Tea!)

POCA (a very authentic Mexican restaurant. This isn't like your standard places. This is a straight from Mexico (classy establishment) type of Mexican (Oaxacan inspired to be specific) with chicken thighs and mole sauce and tamales. This isn't your ""grab a taco"" kind of Mexican. They have guacamole with a nice citrus flavor and robust jalapeño kick which they serve with a side of mole sauce - this stuff has some heat behind it, ayiyi!)

Now let's talk about the bar! And the seating! Omg you guys, we have too much to cover. Am I going to be flagged for saying too much? Will I run out of characters? The world may never know!!!

So once you pop in the doors of the place you can go left to the restaurants or right to the bar... ""right to the bar"" is usually my motto... tehehe. Never fear if you've steered to the left first... this place works in a circle and you can always find your way through the back end of the bar. The open floor and beautiful lights were amazing! Who doesn't want to eat in this kind of environment? The bar was very modern and offered up all kinds of ritzy true mixologist created cocktails with ingredients I had to google, of course. That's a mark of a real trendy place, I tell ya! They have a nice list of fun draft beers too!

The seating is spread all around the place and you can either sit at a larger communal table with others or a smaller table for intimacy. You set your number down from your restaurant of choice and some impressive treasure hunt wizards roam the floor to find you. Truly a difficult task, if you ask me. Kudos! I wonder if the training was successfully finding Waldo in a series of photos LOL - especially food courts. 

All in all I really enjoyed OCG! From a pocket book standpoint, it's not a place you hit up daily. It's pretty expensive, namely the bar, but if you're in the mood for some legitimately homemade cuisines and hand crafted cocktails with a more casual vibe... this is your place!!!",5,R842Gc0ExxNgaKybAumTmw
"This USED TO BE my favorite buffet in Vegas, but WOW has this place fallen. Self serve drink station (EVEN WATER!), plastic drink ware, cheapened food, missing high-end options - no hot tea, no beef Wellington, no banana foster, no king crab legs, etc. How does MGM have the audacity to charge ""Gourmet Dinner"" for the Fourth of July at almost $100 per couple, to serve junk. Well you fooled me once, you will not again. Today, we celebrated our Sunday Brunch at Wicked Spoon and loved it, less expensive and far superior in every aspect.

Do not waste your money at Bellagio, simply go to Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal for the same price or less. 

This is coming from an MGM GOLD PLAYER",1,gt_a4yl8VQ0_wFLxpw-LMw

"This is an update to my previous review on 9/16/2013.  I've now bumped up the rating from a 1 to a 4 for my overall experience.  Lauren L., Customer Advocate Manager, was great.  She promptly followed up with me to discuss my issues I was experiencing.  She was very friendly and genuinely sounded like she was concerned.  Also, my Loan Officer, Erik E, reached out to me to make sure everything was processed timely and followed through to closing.  Everything finally closed a few days late but none the less, closed and finalized.

I originally selected  RoundPoint based on feeling the most comfortable with my Loan Officer after a few initials contacts through phone and email.  They weren't the lowest rates but one of the lowest plus very responsive.  One thing I would say is be aware of and double check all the numbers.  After I decided to go with RoundPoint, they changed the initial offer by charging more fees.  Again, I choose to go with them because I was most comfortable with them but this definitely made be pay closer attention to the rest of the paperwork.  There were a few things here and there (could have been computer or human error) that I caught but RoundPoint corrected those along the way.  I guess this can happen with any bank, so I would recommend to check everything!

I was on the fence about the updated rating but overall gave the 4 based on RoundPoint resolving my issues and promptly taking action.  I feel the added stress and aggravation would have been nice to avoid in the first place but what's important is it was addressed and everything is done now.",5,LsIdLAcR00MeSkR8o_lydw
"This is the newest Starbucks in Oakland - I visited the location for the first time this evening. It is gorgeous on the inside as everything is brand new. The location has plenty of tables or various shapes and sizes for meet ups, relaxation and studying. 

I wish that I had the Barista's name that had waited on me this evening-the location closes at 7pm and during the summer months does not seem to be very busy, as the University is not in session. I arrived around 6pm and asked for my usual-a Grande Pike Place, no cream or sugar. The Barista apologized as they had no brew left-while there was only an hour left for the location to be open, he ended up brewing a fresh pot just for me! How nice-I have to thank him for helping me to get through my evening class today. 

My only complaint is that for a passer by in a vehicle, the location is a little bit hard to get in and out of - I ended up parking across the street on 5th avenue and running through traffic to get into the coffee shop. As a student, however, this is a prime location as you can stop on your way to and from class on the east side of campus.",4,3ldRUougcUfHzQGY4zDGnQ

"I've never liked this place. It's a white washed version of Mexican food. But this time was overall my main reason why I don't like coming here. 

The manager was cussing up a storm. Not only that she was more focused assisting a regular or another coworker off duty to get his food quickly. It made no sense to me. 

It took too long, and the jokes between the cashier and the manager were so inappropriate.",1,RNE9uqCjG_e3XVitBh7nAg
"The service was phenomenal with a special shout-out to Mike who was friendly, attentive, and accommodating. I have a dairy allergy which was easily accommodated. All the steak meals come with soup, salad, and main meal - steak, baked potato, and vegetables. I ordered the Steak Diane which was prepared table side and was cooked to perfection. Probably one of the best steaks I've ever had! Needless to say, we were stuffed by the time we left, but will definitely be back soon. Thank you for a wonderful evening!",5,bokaJEoKgwZIWpp1a9cUYQ
"This restaurant is not very good. A friend and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon while wandering around the distillery district and neither of us were very impressed. Although not very busy it took awhile for the hostess to acknowledge us and the server seemed rushed. We both had burritos which were VERY small and very mediocre in terms of flavour - also way overpriced considering size and taste! Interior of the restaurant is nice though, nice tall ceilings and interesting decor.",2,laU92__8VnNRGpTaL_vmDA

"I love this very laid back unbeknown to many outside of the NoDA area. What I enjoy most is the domino table they have. On the weekend there is some time of live music. My only dismay is that they don't have better wine options. I was so disappointed, especially because they own the shop downstairs that has fantastic wine and wine tastings. I did find a bottle of Rose in the refrigerator. Many brewerie have caught onto the fact that while there are a ton of beer enthusiasts, there are a few of us that don't always want to drink beer, but our friends we are out with do, and we want a fun vibe, like they do at Salud Cerveceria. Always a fan, will continue to return, again and again. Cheers",4,AILTU4HitGEZbyPB3Yy3OQ

The selection is severely limited and there isn't much meat in any of the dishes. The waiter was absent most of the time and I had to specifically ask for naan otherwise they don't even make it.

"I am going to begin giving credit where credit is due.  I have been ordering Chinese food from this restaurant since 2007.  I do not live anywhere close to this area, but I am willing to drive , because of the quality of their food, freshness, taste, and  good size portions. The owners Tony, and Sonya welcome every person possible in their restaurant. They take the time to know the majority of their customers' names, and engage in conversations.  To them you are not just another face that they may or may not see again. They care.  In today's world where dog eats dog it is a fresh breath of air to know there is an establishment where you can connect with the owners, and they truly care about their customers.  And no I was not given any compensation for my review.  My humble opinion that is all.",5,dhKo-ubb7BrCdJ_Z93neGQ
"Avoid this plumbing company like the plague.  

The heat in my apartment stopped working last winter ('10).  The highest temperature my apartment could reach was 63 degrees, which was manageable for sleeping, but way too cold during the day.  

Each time you schedule an appointment with them, they give you a four-hour window when they will show up.  Not only that, but once they show up, it could be for another hour or two.  You essentially need to take the entire day off from work, sitting in your cold house for these guys to show up.  

I had to call these guys three times to come to my house.  
First time: The guy reset the heater.  it worked for about a day and stopped working again.  
Second time:  The guy said the heater was working fine, just that I had to put new AA batteries in my thermostat.  Unfortunately, I had to wait for four hours for the guy (he showed up close to noon), and I had to take off for some afternoon meetings, though I found out that evening it was still not working.  
Third time:  I was really busy at work, so ended up scheduling my appointment for almost a week later.  They still made me wait for about 3 hours.  

Finally, they got the heat working after three visits!  But then, in the summer, I noticed my air conditioner was dripping water!  Water was leaking off the ceiling and down the walls.  A guy came again and it turns out they had not properly replaced some pan!   So, in total, it took them four visits to get everything fixed.",1,_e4fFYx94U1T6DNcdDeU5w

"I'd like to rate it 4.5 stars, but YELP won't let me. We came here for breakfast this morning around 10ish, and it was really good. 

When we walked in, we were allowed to pick our seating and the server was quick to give us menus and offer us drinks. I whipped out my crappy Spanish, and he didn't seem bothered, which was nice (some people get offended when you try to speak their language and fail...whoops). 

I ordered a coffee and my fiance ordered the tamarindo. By the time we got our drinks, we were ready to order. My coffee was tiny! It looked like it was served in a tea set or something, it was kinda cute. Then I noticed the other patrons beside us also ordered coffee and got two regular sized cups...what?

Our food came out relatively fast for homemade food. We both had scrambled eggs (with tomatoes and onions), fresh sliced avocado, and fried plantains. My fiance's food came with refried beans and crema (cream), while mine came with casamientos (whole beans and rice, mixed together). Both were really delicious. They also brought us some tortillas hecho a mano (hand made), which were delicous and perfectly cooked. Mine also came with chorizo (Mexican sausage) but it was one tiny little piece; not significant enough for the price jump between the two dishes. 

Downside? With my tiny cup of coffee, I finished it well before halfway done with my food. They didn't come to check on us for a while, and by the time they did, I was really thirsty. They had to make a fresh pot of coffee, understandable in the mornings, but then the guy spilled it all over the table and saucer and cup and then left....wtf? Thought this was kinda funny, seeing as I would have offered a napkin or a new saucer or wiped it up....

Overall the food and coffee (what I drank) was delicious. Would have liked them to check on us a bit more regarding refills (I drank half of my fiance's tamarindo while waiting for more coffee, and they never gave him anymore either, or offered us water; didn't give us an opportunity to ask either, after the coffee incident). We were waiting for the check for a few minutes after we finished, stacked the plates and piled up the mess, went to the restroom, etc. and they never came. We waited until we saw another guest walk up to the register, and decided to head up front too, though its a bit odd for a sit down restaurant. 

Would come again for the food, but will be prepared to ask for refills in advance and specify what you want (I thought the sausage would have been different; I should have asked, shame on me). I do recommend the food. I usually can't bear to eat eggs (because they taste or smell funny to me) but these were great. Job well done.",4,2nYMjXwjJ9txtx6cMMdhVw
"DA EVITARE!
My husband is Italian and we just moved 2 years ago from Milan to the States. Portofino was by far the worst Italian restaurant we have been in a while.They try to modify traditional Italian plates to a more sophisticated version putting a high price label on it. We had the lasagne which was burned, cold and with ingredients that don't go with it. The spaghetti carbonara had a strange taste. The gnocchi were warmed up and not fresh at all.
The atmosphere is snob and tries to attract the rich ones thinking to find a great Italian spot. There are better places to spend your time and money.
One star because the wine was good. At least they know to choose the wine.",1,4Wb4WO-TMXP_9pbd4bC0Dw
"After much hype and reading the reviews, I decided to go here with my friends for. A nice Friday evening out. To be honest, it was disappointing. We were there early, and I always wondered why there was a line out the door. The reason being that you order and pay up front and hope they have a table. The menu is a giant chalkboard that is kind of hard to read. We luckily were one of a few groups there so we didn't have any trouble. 

We got 3 entrees for 3 people. The Large Shrimp, Pork Chop, and the Lamb Shank. We did not get any drinks, sides: or apps. Our total bill before tip $55.00. Now after paying that much, sitting at the table, and getting the sauces. Our food came. The pork chop was a nice portion size that came with a little salad. The lamb shank was a small size that came with some orzo, and the shrimp. 10 little shrimp. Was the food tasty---yes. Was it worth the money? That's another story.

Now listen, I cook a variety of dishes regularly. I' m a novice baker. I'm a foodie and appreciate great tasting food. I understand that portion sizes may be smaller at some places. I have paid for small portions and felt that it was worth the money. But for $18 and to get 10 shrimp that is supposed to be an entree (aka main course)--no matter how good is disheartening. Everyone of us was not satisfied. We all left hungry. 

In short--expect a wait, expect to drop a pretty penny, and don't order the shrimp.",2,F9UYCEapUo0KCPug7s2U_Q
"Disappointed. 

Get's three stars for the service, and the parts of the meal that were good, and the fact that they didn't gripe when I had to return the rubberiest lobster I've ever seen in my life.  Couldn't cut the sucker with a knife (seriously!).  Geez, Emeril, what are you doing?

Would give it another try, but not get the seafood platter.  Too expensive and poor quality.  I knew there was trouble when they handed it to a manager and told him it was overcooked, and his response was ""Again?""

Still spent $70 (with tip) AFTER they took off a significant amount for the lobster.  That's a lot on my teacher's salary.",2,SET62qdFVQrRwFql0thzpg
"I have been visiting this salon for years, but the quality has gone down recently. I had the worst manicure today. The gentleman that was providing the service made my nails pointy when I asked for them to be oval, I ended up filing them myself while he watched. The water to soak my hand was ice cold. And the nail polish was applied so thick, after waiting two hours to do some chores around the house, so I could ensure my nails were dry, 4 of them smudged right away. 

I have loved visiting Jamie and her team there for years, but in the last year or so, I haven't had one good service there. Today was the last one I'll be getting from this place. 

What use to be the first place I'd recommend to anyone has become overpriced for shoddy work.",1,CM1SCa78EHMKkGrLuVo_Lg

I buy my pork butts, steaks, and ground beef here and all have been SO MUCH better than anything at Smith's/Von's/etc. They are super friendly and  have been great about my ridiculous special orders (they cut me a pork butt to fit my crock pot exactly!!). I also love their fun selection of meat accompaniments - everything from beer to hawaiian sea salt can be found on their shelves!

My only dream is that they would focus more on free range, hormone free products. They do typically have grass fed beef (which I love!), but I'd enjoy even more humane-type meat products. Overall this butcher is excellent, and remains my #1 choice for meats in Henderson.",5,rpvCp43EoCeh7dc3YNAEbA

it has some grocery items, so if you are wondering what filipino food taste like or how the usual store is in philippines...go to Lolit's that is how some of the eatery back home.

i love their pinakbet as well. there are so many good food there. it depends when you go...the food entre changes..you can also call in and pre-order and you can go pick it up.

they also serve breakfast stuff, again, just need to call and they can prepare it for you. they are open 6 days a week. i think its like 10-7pm is their store hours.

i highly recommend to try it out, but its only take out. so, go to the eatery after work (if you work regular hours that is).

oh, if you have parties, you can order like for big group. i guess you have to go there prior then order and pay, then you come pick it up on the date you need it. i si say",4,rEKFMr5ZOzmPm-r3yzyFNw
"They fixed my laptop when another place couldn't. My laptop screen stopped working. The UBreak IFix place on McKnight admitted they didn't know what was wrong but an hour later told me my motherboard was dead and the only thing they could do was rescue my hard drive. I wanted a second opinion, so I took it to Aquilis on 2/22. They connected my laptop to an external monitor which showed my computer functioning just fine minus the broken screen. They ordered a new screen, which didn't fix the issue so they kept trying - new screens, new wires, etc. Then they ordered a new motherboard which finally fixed the problem. They kept trying possible solutions and called me with updates where the other place gave up. They called 4/9 to tell me my laptop is ready for pick up.

"My husband and I looked at an address wrong for a restaurant we were going to try.  Long story short, we were at the wrong casino.  We decided to stay at Palazzo.  We love the Palazzo and have never had a bad experience here and figured we couldn't go wrong.  However, this is my least favorite dining expereince I've had to the Venetian or Palazzo.

SushiSamba was having their happy hour on Friday 4-7.  We sat up at the bar and ordered off their happy hour menu.  We each decided to try the Caipirinhas.  I'd equate this to a Brazilian margarita.  I think the bartender said it has rum instead of tequila???  Not positive though.  She hands the drinks to us and says something to the effect of ""This isn't my favorite drink, but it gets the job done"".  We didn't ask her if it was a good, bad or indifferent drink.  We just wanted to try something off their happy hour menu that we'd never tried before.  I thought it was a rather odd comment to make.  Then when we tried it, we weren't crazy about it either.  If she was going to say something, she should've told us when we ordered.  Regardless, the drink kind of grew on us.  Didn't order a second and probably won't order the drink again, but it wasn't horrible.

As far as food, we tried the chicken anticuchos, shrimp tempura roll, salmon taquitos and yellowtail seviche.  Chicken anticuchos were good....basically a chicken skewer with teriyaki.  Shrimp tempura roll was average.  Salmon taquitos were kind of strange...if you do order these, make sure to put the spicy sauce on them.  Without the sauce, they aren't very good.  Last but not least, the dish I truly enjoyed was the yellowtail seviche.  The yellowtail was buttery and spicy all at the same time....very good.

All said and done, our tab was just under $40 before tip.  Not bad.  However, there was something about this place, I don't see myself ever coming back here.  Other than the yellowtail, nothing was that good.  Average to mediocre at best.",2,g7eh7KN3OO8oTd8MqoxZ7w

I was having panic attacks the entire way to the restaurant because I WORK in a busy restaurant, and I know the repercussions of being almost an hour late with a party of 18 on a Saturday night.

"Is zero stars an option? So I live close by here and I have tried this restaurant a few times and never had the best experience but after today I have given up all hope. I went to have lunch there with my friend and when we walked in the hostess was just looking around and so we waited in the doorway for a second and then I said ""hi there"", again she was doing nothing but looking around.. So I finally said ""hi, 2 please"" and she did not even respond, she just picked up menus and so we followed her to our table. Then we sat at our table for I'm not even joking atleast 10 mins. We saw 6 girl servers walking around the almost empty restaurant and none of them ever acknowledged us. I would have gone to ask the hostess if we had a server but she so clearly hated her job that I knew she would be no help. Finally the pack of 6 servers were standing together and I hear one of them go ""who has that table"" and all the girls just look at each other. One of them finally comes up to our table and says sorry she was caught up outside and she will be our server. We give her our drink order and ask to order our food now as well. (Obviously we were ready to order since we had just been starring at our menus for 15 minutes). The server did not seem happy about this. So we order an appetizer and our entrées and the girl walked away. After about 5 minutes a different server comes and drops off our drinks. And later a different server brings our appetizer while our server is following behind her with our entrées. While it was nice that our food came out quick, we would have obviously wanted a little time to enjoy the appetizer so our entrées wouldn't have to sit there and get cold. Our server never came back the entire time that we ate, both of our drinks were empty. The food there is spicy, so obviously you want a drink while you're eating. The server finally came back at the end when we were almost done with all of our food and asked if we were ready for the checks, never even offering to give us refills. Overall it was just a horrible experience. The staff there either just hate their jobs or don't care at all about having a sense of urgency... also maybe the servers should just have an inside or outside section, not both considering they can't seem to remember where all their tables are. Never again will we try this place. Such a disappointment.",1,XK7QPWWASWh9oPvdyv3bpg
"I will start with the positive:
The ambiance is on point- it feels super posh and chic-- it's a place you want to sit and have a drink in. Our server was superb- she was sweet, knowledgable and attentive.  

Now for the food... We ordered the 'Chile Relleno' empanadas, Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs, a Flatbread of some sort and a nice bottle of pinot. The wine was great; I have nothing but praise for our wine! As for the empanadas, I think I could get better frozen empanadas from Trader Joes. They're ok if you want that frozen, heated in a convection oven type of a meal- which I do sometimes, but just not at top dollar. The meatballs were ok, a little hard- like maybe they put too much bread crumbs in the mix. They weren't the worst, but they had a sort of golf ball element to them. The flatbread was good, because hey- how can you screw up bread? 

I think this place is great to come for a cocktail hour or a glass of wine at the bar while you wait for a table to open up next door. Just know you're paying for ambiance, not the quality of food.",3,Egr7ihjyZZFFV-MIxslYaw

"This Courtyard has had the lobby and rooms renovated, modernizing a business traveler chain with vibrant colors and clean, modern lines.  24hr fitness center and indoor pool.  Located near campus but also close to local businesses, the mall and a bunch of restaurants.

Yeah, it's located by the highway... but... uhm that's where hotels are usually located.  I'm in a room that faces the highway right now, and I can barely hear the traffic.  No biggie.

My one beef with the renovated Courtyards is that breakfast is no longer included in the price of the room.  While I'm not a huge breakfast eater, especially when I'm on the road, I can't help but hum 'Don't Know What You Got' every morning I walk out the door to my rental car.",4,IqMyF47GsOtQqpatWFKs6g
"I have decided that I need to be writing more reviews since I base so many of my experiences on what other Yelpers have to say yet I have never sat down to write a review myself. This Vet is going to change that.

I could easily go on and on about how amazing this place is, but it would inevitably repeat what many others have said so I'll try to make it short...ish.

After being TERRIBLY dissatisfied with The Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic I seeked the guidance of Yelpers to help me find a new Vet for my dog Slapshot who was having a mixture of issues with arthritis and stomach problems. After reading so many good reviews of BCVC and comparing them to various great reviews for other places, my gut instinct (and the feeling that BCVC treats 1st time visitors with love and care; many other places have good reviews from folks going there for 20 years. That doesn't help me determine how they are with 1st time visitors) led me to give them a try. BOY am I glad I did!! I called one morning and they were able to get me in that afternoon with Dr. Ryan. She is a GODSEND when compared to the many vets I have visited in the past. She is kind, honest, INCREDIBLY caring, and she understands folks being in financial distress. I dont make much money, so when it's time to go to the vet, I get that queezy, I'm-about-to-spend-$400 feeling in my stomach. Not anymore. After thoroughly checking out Slap's symptoms and actually LISTENING to what I had to say, Dr. Ryan printed out a quote and went through each and every option with me. We decided what was best to do now and what could wait. The quote was for over $400 and I left, HAPPILY spending $179 (X-Rays & Exam), despite the potential that Slapshot may have a life-threatening tumor. She was so thorough and caring that she wanted me to give her a call the next week to bring Slap by so she could feel the tumor and see if it was growing or shrinking, free of cost and appointment. All I had to do was call to make sure she was there and I could stop by.

Turns out, Slap was having some issues with the aspirin we started giving him for his arthritis and after 2 weeks, he was acting kinda strange. We called and talked to Dr. Ryan and she wanted to set up a formal appointment to make sure she had the time to do a thorough exam. After an in-depth exam, we have noticed a decrease in the tumor size and believe the intestinal problems were due to the aspirin. She prescribed 2 pills to help clear out his GI Tract as well as Tramadal for his arthritis as it will not have the harmful side effects of aspirin. (Despite prescribing 3 medications, she is very fond of providing over-the-counter and ""natural"" forms of relief. Foods you can feed, etc. in hopes of avoiding unnecessary medications, so those who feel like they are always bombarded by "" your dog NEEDS to take THESE pills"" will feel great comfort with Dr. Ryan)

When we were paying at the counter (which, I forgot to mentioned is staffed with awesome, caring, genuine people who you cant help but smile around and feel like even THEY care passionately about your animal) we were given the total of $42 for the 3 different pills and told that the visit fee had been waved by Dr. Ryan bc she wanted us to come in formally vs just stopping by for a quick check. How can you not LOVE THAT!?!?

Ok, I lied, this isn't a short review, but I just had to tell my story and this is only the surface of it. Long story short. I have NEVER been so happy with ANY Dr experience in my life. And quite honestly, if I go there and face $400 of work to make Slap better, I wont question her judgement one bit bc I KNOW she only has OUR (myself, Slapshot, and MY wallet) BEST interest at heart. She knows how much money things are and if she tells me that I NEED to pay for it, I will. I have yet to walk out that door with ANY REGRET.

I can't speak for any of the other Dr's (although everyone who comes in for care seems to leave the same way I do), but trust me when I say that Dr. Ryan is AWESOME and if you are looking to find a new vet, you should ABSOLUTELY give her a shot!! And the place is clean and bright and the staff is AWESOME and they offer treats and kisses (for the dogs) as you pay your not-as-high-as-every-other-vet-bill. Not sure of the general exam cost but I want to say it is $45 compared to the +/- $65 that I was charged at Scottsdale Vet Clinic (and a few others that I had called in the past). That alone is worth giving them a visit. Dr. Ryan and staff will do the rest of the convincing themselves!!

10 STARS and 4 PAWS UP!!!  Thank You Dr. Ryan & Blue Cross Staff, I have my vet for life!!

They did it no problem. They suggested what was open around in the area in case I need more service. The staff was kind and easy-going and helpful. The kind woman working there just checked my pressure, filled it up with a smile and told me to have a great weekend.

Really cool. I've only had good experiences here. They've always only ever been truly helpful. Plus it is a convenient location. It's right off of Macleod Trail.

"Friday night at Madison's hottest new restaurant, and let me tell you like it was.  First,  it was packed, and VERY VERY noisy, I had to shout to talk to my table mates.  Second, we arrived at 6:30, can't recall when our drinks arrived (7PM?) but our first plates ($3 for 6 SMALL pieces of bread) arrived at 7:20.  The second round of plates arrived at 7:40.  Grits and an egg, which was good but strange.  The bread was long gone, so there I am eating just grits, and an egg.  The third round arrived at 8 PM.  I got the mac & cheese, which was cold; not lukewarm, COLD.   I got heartburn --- probably from drinking beer on an empty stomach and the weird parings becasue who eats grits and an egg on a Friday night and 20 minutes later cold mac & cheese?  Also got a sore throat from shouting and my clothes smelled like I had been in a cheap diner.  (But of course this place is pretty expensive, given the small portions.)  Oh, the wait staff -- there were four or five different people throughout the evening taking our order, bringing food and drinks clearing stuff away -- who is our server?  Who's service do we base our tip on?  They got orders mixed up, who get's what again now? I found it discombobulating.  Bottom line, I did not enjoy the expereince at all.",3,o7K9KM9UE5_cM7oPM_vIXA

The price was extremely reasonable and I am elated for how fantastic the entire job turned out!  I was very nervous as I had a very large granite project that required 6 slabs of granite...Full backsplash kitchen, bar, oversized island, and very, very long bathroom vanities that required true mastery.  Joe told me that they are ""the best"" and not to worry...boy was he ever right!  To say the least, they are by far the best I have seen, and I have remodeled many homes with different granite contractors...the project was perfectly done and is gorgeous.  I will never use anyone else again for home improvements.  From being on time, to communication, to professionalism, to true craftsmanship, Optimum Home Soultions has it all.

"I would have to say that I havent ever been that picky about getting my nails done. I have been loyal to an establishment once I get in there and see what the talent available is there. In san diego I was with the same salon for 8 years but in that 8 years I did find the one person I truly liked having my nails done by so I followed her to her own shop making our time together much longer. So in saying that, I havent been in Vegas long enough to setup more than an establishment loyalty.
Then I met Sasha. I had been going to a salon here for a while but I guess I was somewhat tired of feeling like a number and getting frustrated with intermittent shotty nails that would last a month one time and then fall off 2 days after getting them done other times. I found Sasha through yelp and others working in the Icon Salon and after seeing her work and verbally hearing her praises I decided to get an appointment and try her on for size. Sasha is very talented when it comes to nails. She uses the gels (which I hadnt ever done before and was seriously skeptical of because I am seemingly hard on my nails). She does 3D artwork and shes open to new designs and suggestions. She prefers her clients to be somewhat knowledgeable of what they are asking for from her as an artist. She doesnt use the dremel looking sander to prep the nail for fills, rather she uses just a nail file. This is beneficial to your nails as it doesnt dig down into the bed of the nail and cause the nails to be so thin and brittle. This is a huge advantage for me in that I have been wearing nails since I was about 20.
I highly recommend Sasha as she is easy to get along with and you will be getting quality nails by choosing her as your ""Master Nail Specialist"" (yep, made that one up!).",5,sH8pjDFFULEkAD1epBDtQw

First time eating here and it was sooo delicious! I ordered the Kalua pork nachos and the sauce was to die for! Everything about was perfect and it filled me up pretty quick. I also tried the crunchy spam musubi and I'm normally a person who just likes to stick to the regular musubi but wow this one was a game changer. There's a pink sauce on it that tastes so good and the crunch of the breaded spam was on point! I also tasted a garlic shrimp from my boyfriends plate and thought that was close to the garlic shrimp from Hawaii. Lastly I tried the Ube and pineapple ice cream in a Keiki cup and the flavor was delicious! Totally recommend making room for that after your meal. The shop itself was very clean and ascetically pleasing reminded me of home. The workers were so friendly always checking up on my family and I. 14/10 recommend coming here and spreading the aloha!

"It's nice to be able to grab some authentic Filipino food close to downtown! I went with three friends for the Kamayan Feast and we all left pretty full. The portions are a good size and you get a ton of food - mango salad, orange slices, okra, egg plant, fish, pork skewers, seafood etc. At $15/person you honestly can't go wrong. 

I made our reservation for 7pm on a Tuesday and arrived right on time. I was concerned because there were no empty tables. We waited outside for a few minutes for a table to clear and were seat around 7:15 or so. I highly recommend making a reservation because it was packed on a week day night! I would also request to sit outside because it seemed kind of tight inside.

I would have given 5 stars, but had to take one off because we ordered water several times and were never brought our drinks. To be quite honest, this deterred us from ordering dessert as well.",4,W9RU-uWEcWDaHU4Omzcmsg
"Decent quality for the price.

I ordered one of the company's much talked about photo books shortly after Christmas. I uploaded the photos from my phone via the Shutterfly app and after filling out the billing and shipping info, I know that I had probably only spent a handful of minutes designing the look and feel of my book. Seriously, my part was done and over with after maybe four minutes and then I called it a day. I didn't put much effort forth in creating my ""masterpiece,"" so I didn't know what to expect. I'd never used Shutterfly before this, but the process seemed pretty quick and painless, not to mention fairly inexpensive, so I was down for it. After all, I didn't spend hours copiously designing fancy borders and all for my book, so maybe my expectations were not ridiculously high.

I received my book in the mail before the estimated ship date, which meant the turnaround was  about 8-9 days. I thought that post-Christmas, the timing seemed pretty reasonable.  Overall, I was pleased with the majority of the book. The cover looked great and most of the pictures came out quite well. However, two of the photos that I uploaded from my Iphone that looked exquisite as they were didn't come out so well. For some reason, they were not cropped appropriately or anything. It's like they just cut off at the bottom. I don't understand it and I was rather looking forward to seeing those two photos in my photo book as they appeared in their original form, but unfortunately, the shots (which were selfies) don't look like they do on my phone or on FB or Instagram, where I also uploaded them.

I'm disappointed by that and had no idea that they would turn out like that. Did I need to crop them myself or was that the fault of Shutterfly? I truly don't know, but either way, I don't see why the perfectly gorgeous photos were laid out as they were on the pages when they don't look like that in my phone or when I printed them from FB. Weird.

The rest of the photos looked high quality and the pages were laid out in the order in which the pics were uploaded to the app. I was pleased with the rest of the book, the cover came out just as I hoped it would and the overall price of the book wasn't bad (retails for $29.99 and up), especially with the first time user discount applied to it. Still, those two shots that were haphazardly chopped off do stick out like a sore thumb. 

One odd thing that I noticed, though? The photo book pages have a rather distinctive, fairly strong smell to them that I hope will dissipate with time. 

Will I use the Shutterfly app/website to order more products in the future? I'm willing to give them another try. I still like the overall product and the process is as easy as can be. I'm a busy girl, so something that is that user-friendly always gets points with me.",4,9_NgUcqfgrkAJwrWFYbIJA

"Best staff in NODA.  They are honest about the beers based on your preferences, mix good cocktails, and are generally just happy likable people that give good service.  It gets a bit crowded on Fridays, Saturdays and some random weekdays too and has a great vibe during the slower days of the week as well.  I love the old wooden door that is now a large table in the middle of the place, great style.    

Beer selection is always well varied and it's rare I can'y find something I'm happy with.  The food is great and some of my favorites are the pork belly tacos, the reuben, broccoli slaw and french fries, best in the neighborhood.  One of the few places in town with cask beer and a real beer engine. They sell a good bit of it so it's always fresh.  Check out the specials on the off nights, really good deals.  

If you are looking for a Cheers, this might it.  Had I not recently moved I might not be writing this review as I didn't want this place to get any busier. 

I almost forgot, the oysters are fantastic and a surprise for this place.  Would never had guessed it.  Get an oyster shot if you're brave enough, they are outstanding.  Oh, did I mention free popcorn too?!?

"*4.5 stars* (I'm getting really mean with my 5 star reviews)

Within approximately 5 minutes of entering Bang Fitness I was flat on my back on the turf while a bearded man palpated the bony prominences of my pelvis. And you know what? I liked it. That's not because of a case of pogonophilia (Google it-it's real!) but because this was Geoff, the owner of the gym, and he wanted to see if I was physically OK to do the class I'd signed up for. Somebody actually cared enough to ask about injuries and experience before just taking my crumpled deal voucher and running.

They say they do things differently at Bang, and that was evident even before I first arrived. I had bought a Groupon for classes, and in typical fashion left it until it was near expiry to use. They were prompt in answering emails and after a few failed attempts I eventually made it in for my first class. I was a bit confused by the setup intially. It's on the second floor and I could mainly see an MMA gym. It turns out that the MMA bit is on the left and Bang is in the same space on the right after you round the initial corner. You have to take your shoes off when you walk in the door and in the changing rooms so I erred on the side of caution and brought indoor shoes. You can often work out barefoot or in socks too. 

The strangest thing about Bang is the people who work there. They're all incredibly nice and friendly. They learn your name and remember it. They know when you've been in and what you've done. They notice if your form slips and correct it. They increase the intensity if it looks like it's too easy. They are all super enthusiastic about getting you moving well and avoiding injury. It's like physio and a kick-ass gym combined. I felt like I was being welcomed into a family!

Most of the classes I did were with Steve-kettlebells and Friday morning kick-ass conditioning. I absolutely adored and still adore these classes. Sizes are generally small (max 12, often less). They are always challenging but always fun and you absolutely will get fitter. I will probably always maintain that it's a good idea to actually learn some basic kettlebell techniques before trying a class anywhere; but they do correct form at Bang. The KB class is usually 5 exercises for 3 sets; then a second set of 5 for 3 sets before tabatas. Izumi Tabata is a Japanese researcher who was part of a group that came up with the bright idea of trying to kill you for 20 seconds followed by 10 seconds of rest for 8 cycles. I looked him up on Google images to see if I could get revenge. He looks innocuous so I could probably take him. I'd have no hope of taking Steve down unless he tripped over me. He's a strong guy. To be fair though, they're worth doing-they've been proven to increase conditioning. And the guys here are all about the research. 

Kick-ass conditioning is different every week. I just love it because I never know what to expect. It's circuit style and I've done stuff like hit a tire with a sledgehammer, I've pulled and pushed a sled, done box jumps, slammed medicine balls and carried a keg.  You never know what's in store but it is always fun and it is always a great workout. It cures any inner rage. Steve is funny and the time just flies.

I did one Olympic lifting class. I was terrible but Ron was lovely. He was so patient, the class was small and technique was heavily emphasized. It's a pity it just didn't fit with my schedule to go to more.

I did one circuit class with Andy on a Monday which was different again-band work, kettlebells, lunges. I knew I'd been working the next day!

I decided on a trial month which included a programme and 3 semi-private coaching sessions. They do a full assessment on you including a functional movement screen and devise a programme to fix deficiencies and help towards your goals. I tried some exercises I had never done before and got lots of useful tips and corrections on things I'd been doing for a while. I'm even trying to put my shoulders down where they should be while I type now. My nutrition consultation was mercifully brief-I basically said I knew I was eating badly anyway. We discussed more habit-based nutrition tips which was nice and has made more of a difference than if they had just handed me a diet plan and expected me to stick to it. As if! I'm excellent at ignoring diet plans. 

I ran out of space to say more but agree with the other reviewers (also read filtered)!

At the moment, my plan is to sign up for a class card because it doesn't suit me time or money-wise to get membership. I'm not willing to leave the place yet though and enjoy the classes far too much to not go again. And I'm not usually a group exercise type! Definitely go, check the place out. Do a drop-in class, have a look around, consider a trial month. Doing things differently is exactly what is needed!

Ralph made everything so easy.  I told him what I wanted and it was like he had it waiting for me at the door.  They gave me a very fair trade for my 2003 Highlander and didn't flinch when I couldn't make up my mind on whether I wanted to buy or lease.  It was the easiest car buying experience I've ever had.  I've been back to the service department for a few things and they have always been great.  They get me in when its convenient for me and always do what's promised.  They never try to push unnecessary things off on me and they take top notch care of  me.  I can't wait until this lease is up so that I can go in and do this all over again because they really do make you more than comfortable.

"The ambiance was great. The food was okay. The service was absolutely terrible. I have a gluten allergy and when an order came with the pork marinated with beer, which wasn't mentioned on the menu, (tastes awesome, but will kill me) the waiter offered to get me a different order. He was really nice, and I ordered chicken instead, thanked him profusely. The new order looked like someone had just dumped ingredients in a pile, chicken was dry and flavorless. Later in the evening, he came by and actually stood with his back to me and faced my friend to ask him how everything was, and not me. Refused to refill our water. I tipped over 20% on our total order to show my appreciation for his extra help, despite the weirdness -- totally understand that allergies can be annoying for wait staff. When he put our extra food in a box, he dumped everything upside down. I would recommend using caution with this one.

"Still my favorite pizza of all time.  Ok Za in SF is a close runner-up.  Pizza is definitely not for those who are lactose intolerant and they douse the pizza with what seems like a half pound of fresh mozzarella, but it's an amazing treat.  They sell the pizza by the slice, but its not as good as when you order an entire pizza where they bury all the toppings under the cheese.  There must be something about everything baking together that makes it taste so good.  They've been in business for 50 years now so I'm""m definitely in the majority on this one.

"Will Do In A Pinch

I usually do not shop at Ross, however, when I do, I usually find great deals. This Ross Dress for Less location is cleaner and more open than other local Ross stores I have visited. 

Once you enter the store, you are greeted by store associates. Everything is well layed out, with  department signs hanging from their respective ceiling spots.

Ross has a variety of home accessories, from kitchen, bathroom to the bedroom, and these items can be purchased for quite a discount from other stores that sell the similar  items.

I have never purchased clothing from Ross.  However, the clothing selection appears to be well stocked, and the shoe selection apoears plentiful as well. There is a jewelry department if you need some earings, watches or bracelets. 

Ross is a good place to get discounts if you don't mind spending sometime looking around.",4,OLEqMo2IJuLRBd6uAwyU7Q
"This place was incredible! Great food...great service...too bad I woke up from my dream.

 I love good jajiang mein and jampong.  I was so excited about coming here.  This place is disappointingly average.

We ordered jajiang mein, jampong and Gan Peng Ji.

Jajiang mein..sauce average.  Noodle was in one big klump, which means it was sitting there for a while before they brought it out.  In my opinion these noodles should be al dente (as the Italians would say) or QQ ( as the taiwanese would day) or chewy and springy (as Mike K) would say.  You guessed it...these noodles are not. 

Jam Pong.  I got the non spicey since my stomach has betrayed me and I can't eat spicey now.  But even with no spice this broth was excellent.  But the noodles....just like the jajiang mein..has no body or chew.

Gan Peng Ji.  I don't understand all these places that make it with a tomato paste.  It's supposed to be a soy garlic sauce. Here they make it with tomato paste.  Not only is it not good..but really over priced.  Normally korean restaurants give you a big portion of this even if it's not good..but here..small for $14.99.

On the really positive side...really good service..",4,gHgcuSXVSBoE15KH-3Mu1w

"I've eaten here numerous times for...of course their noodles! That is what they are famous for! Service is always very fast. I usually go in, sit at any table, order my food when the waitress comes to give me my chopsticks, put my stuff down, go get tea/water...and by the time I'm done all that in a short period of time the food is already here! Talk about fast!!! One time I think my food came as fast as 30 seconds!

Anyways, I usually get the fish ball rice noodle or the wonton rice noodle. What I love the most about this place is the spicy chili oil. So delicious and spicy! I have an entire jar at home and I'm almost done the entire jar (definitely need to go get more). Just a huge warning though, it is very spicy so if you are unable to handle spicy, don't put so much or your mouth will be on fire.

"The restaurant is sparkling with nice furniture and a definitely eye catchy bar. The moment you step inside, it does appeal you giving you a sense of cleanliness and luxury. Once you are seated in your table, you get this cramped feeling - obviously the restaurant is a bit smaller and has packed more tables than it should. You are provided with bread and oregano as a free appetizer. Not very appetizing, would have loved if they had hummus instead. The menu gives you a variety of Mediterranean options with some sandwich options that may be for the not so adventurous patrons. The options are indeed fun with a twist. The Arrarat cutlet gets a definite vote of innovation from me - a chicken hot pocket packed with spinach and mushrooms! The food came in with an extra delay than you would normally wait for. I could relate the delay with the 'now hiring' sign posted on the outside door. The food wasn't so bad - but it didn't really seem like a carefully orchestrated menu. You can order three sides from hummus, veg Salad, rice, French fries or mashed potatoes. Except for veg salad and rice, I found it rather difficult accompanies to meat. Are you supposed to choke down on the hummus or mashed potatoes? The French fries are not your regular American fries - I found them rather larger chunks of unappetizing steamed or baked potatoes. For a cuisine known for their meats, found that their chicken or lamb was not succulent and juice. They were much more hard and rubbery, it does definitely become a struggle point of your meal. The portions are good but it's on the pricey side - about 35-40$ for two with just entrees.

Summing up Arrarat definitely tries to set itself apart from other Mediterranean restaurants by giving a great ambience and styling, with an innovative menu. With all that well done, the food is not top of its class.",3,0KEsx60SCAb2PgkAJg2zYQ

Very nice casino to come to if you just wanna sit smoke drink and watch sports at the sports bar. My favorite spots are the wheel of fortune. I have amazing luck with them and they all seem pretty lose. Never gone negative on them anyways. The food court has a diversity of food. The theaters is a nice place and pretty cheap if you go on $5 dollar Mondays. Been coming here almost everyday for about two years now and it feels like a home sometimes I spend so much time here haha. Wheyher I'm enjoying the amazing shows that they have. The most recent event I went to that I absolutely loved was the jay cutler bodybuilding even. It was a pretty interesting venue with all the huge dudes walking around. Felt pretty small. The prices compared to the view you get from any part of the hotel is worth it and amazing.

"PRIX FIX MENU: http://www.mgmgrand.com/pdf/menu_robuchon_prixfixe.pdf

The menu on YELP is very confusing.
Dine in date: July 30, 2014

We chose Menu A $250 (l'amuse bouche, 2 apps, 2 main courses, 1 dessert, a seductive sweet cart), the cheese trolley was extra so I'm not sure why they have it on the above link.  Also, sometimes they change their menu around (I think).

L'amuse-bouche: something with kale
it was just average

COLD APPS:
L'oursin - sea urchin in orange vinaigrette, delicate gelee of green asparagus with turmeric.
Le Crabe Royale - Alaskan King crab, salad of avocado & tomato in a heart of romaine & olive oil.

I got the sea urchin, my partner got the king crab; I don't recommend the sea urchin.  I don't like to the fact that it seems like you can taste the fishiness.  If you like Chinese bamboo shoots that smells like cow fertilizer or urine, then try it...but I don't like it.  

HOT APPS:
Le Foie Gras de Canard - Grilled foie gras, bell pepper confit in acacia honey.
L'oeuf de Poule - Deep-fried boiled eggs in light Comte cheese sauce with iberico de bellota ham. 

Foie gras was cook to perfection, this was awesomely delicious...my mouth is watering as I'm typing this review reminiscing the taste of the perfect foie gras in my mouth.

I can't remember if I like the deep-fried boiled eggs.

MAIN COURSES:

La Langouste - Spiny lobster roasted in a shellfish jus with spinach leaves and lemongrass emulsion.
Le Bar - Pan seared sea bass in salted butter with baby artichoke sauce.

Both tasted delicious.  My partner LOOOOVEd his sea bass more than my lobster.

Le Boeuf - Beef cheeks braised with eggplant in red miso & ginger sauce, medley of bell peppers
Le Poulet Fermier - Caramelized farm chicken with foie gras, farro risotto with snow peas.

Beef cheeks were tender, my partner didn't care for his chicken dish because he was expecting the foie gras he tasted from mine. 

DESSERTS:

Les Herbes - Green chartreuse sabayon topped with herb sorbet & a hazelnut praline
L'Abricot - Sugar pearl filled with apricots & panna cotta, cubes of seasonal fruit gelee with verbena.

Les Herbes was the winner on this one.  The L'Abricot was too citrusy for me. 

Mignardises - seductive sweets trolley 
I asked for 1 of each but they told me only 5/ person can choose 1, so we had 10 different things.  Surprisingly, I didn't like the macaroons.  Creme Brulee was OK...I didn't care for a lot of the sweets they offered on their trolley.

OVERALL, if you have the money, won a lot of money, love french food, just want to try fine dining or in vegas; then you should try it, after all it's the only 3 Michelin star restaurant in Vegas.  
I like how they give the diners the freedom to choose whatever you like instead of 1 table getting the same kind of menu or chefs tasting.  So yes, if you prefer getting a main course while the other party at your table is getting 11 courses so you can pick on theirs then you're allowed; different than Melisse & Providence.

I'm giving this a 4 star because I was famish upon our arrival and was experiencing hunger pains.   The service of just giving us a menu took too long.  They also messed up on our bill & charged us an extra $169, but they corrected that error.  Everyone will have different experiences.  I'd definitely would like to come back and just order the foie gras & maybe try other things depending how much I win at the table.",3,TyFRi2xDfIB9wFP5xLhCyA

"Absolutely bewildered at the high ratings for these places across the valley. Wife and I decided to pick up some food from the Blue Diamond location because our new favourite for ""quick and honest"" Mexican fare, Phat Phranks, is closed on weekends.

As I watched them build my burritos my heart sank and I knew I wasn't going to be in for a pleasant experience. The meat was wet, beans were swimming in goo and the tortillas split from the wetness as they wrapped it. My wife's bean and cheese burrito was even worse - 48.5% rice, 48.5% wet beans, 1% of a tiny sprinkle of cheese.

When we went to eat our meals the burritos were predictably soggy, vaguely unpleasant tasting -- revolting beans -- and generally yucky. I found it just edible and would rate the place 1 and a half stars overall, rounding down because it's a bit overpriced and I just didn't enjoy the taste.",1,aFooI_8OBWn_MUQSxRROWw

"I have stopped at Noodlehead many times for take out. The food is always good. My husband and I have tried something different each time. 

I am writing this review because Noodlehead does NOT have a phone or I would have called to talk to a manager. I went to the restaurant today. As I waited for my order, I witnessed a waitress/hostess with long blonde hair (few dread locks in the back) who was so terribly rude/mean/disrespectful to several customers. She threw her hands in the air to a lady who was inquiring about a few empty tables and said very rudely and loudly and in the lady's face, ""Be My Guest, take the table!  It is meant for larger parties, but go ahead and do what you want"" And then she threw a glass bottle with such force into the garbage can where I was sitting, it broke in the can. Next, several men were standing in her way and she very rudely said, ""move over there, you are directly in my way""... Not, ""excuse me""..  

Customer service and good food go hand in hand. I hope the people who pay her to work for them know how she is treating THEIR paying customers!   I am giving a 2 because of the atmosphere today. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed for the customers.",1,gyAfX8eCGa_bXJ45XEX1EQ
"NOT the place for steaks in Madison or, for that matter, not the place for much else in terms of decently priced and tasty food. There are far too many other options in Madison and the surrounding area for top quality steak houses. 
 
The NY Strip was average at best and over priced- at $28.00. It lacked real strip flavor and if it was charcoal grilled- it certainly wasn't evident. 

The 6oz Salmon was also over priced at $30.00 but that was complimented by also being over cooked and not very fresh. That one-two punch was covered up by cooking it on a cedar plank and drowning the fish in a cranberry relish.",2,u9yN8lfqtVguyCqtSAf5QA

"I came here for dinner about a month ago on a Friday night with my family of 5. The restaurant was a small place, and it was busy, but we were seated in about 10 minutes without a reservation. I've been here a few times and have had a good experience consistently. 

We were craving sushi, so we ordered a huge boat of sushi. We were each given a small bowl of salad and miso soup soon afterwards. The soup didn't have that msg aftertaste you'd find at some places, and the dressing on the salad was just right; not too sour, not too sweet, not too bland, not too much. The sushi came in about 10 minutes, and for the amount that we ordered, that was pretty fast. We had an assortment of raw fish, including no tuna and hamachi, as well as raw squid, avocado, and sea urchin. All of it tasted fresh and delicious. The sushi didn't have too much rice like some places, and the fish servings were adequate. We also got a soft shell crab roll, which had avocado, cucumber and cream cheese. My family didn't like the cream cheese in it but I thought it was good so I ate all of it.

What I find stood out to me was that every time I've went with my family, they always bring us something random that's on the house. I'm not sure if that's something they do often or just with larger groups. They use ""scrap"" pieces of fish such as the bits of meat missed when filleting a fish and make it into something delicious. This time, they made a hot dish of salmon pieces with onions, bean sprouts, carrots and sauce. The salmon was done well but had bones in it. It was free though so I can't really complain. It's a nice touch, and I like the idea of not wasting food. 

Overall, this is probably one of my favourite sushi restaurants and I'd definitely come back another time.",4,S4C3eo-gNCIjg1BrSutHZw
"A delight for a LV restaurant -- however, not up to par with Gagnaire's other restaurants at the Mandarin properties (e.g., Pierre at the Mandarin in Hong Kong).

"So this is a unique property. The staff was very good and friendly despite staying there Christmas Eve. The event rooms are incredibly amazing, if I lived in Cleveland I would try to find an excuse to use them. Our room was clean and well prepared. The interior decorating is modern in style, which is fine, but poorly executed. For example there is no actual door in the suites between rooms. This is a problem when the whole reason you booked a suite was so that the baby could sleep undisturbed in the other room. beyond that, lots of weird choices: the couch requires that you recline at 45 degrees which is very awkward, the trashcans are about one liter in size, the water doesn't stay in the sink, the fancy faucets are difficult to turn on/off one-handed, etc. Looks very nice and I really appreciate the bare floors. See other posts about parking. 

Basically this will be great for you UNLESS one of the very odd choices by the decorator is a trigger for you. The strangest thing is that all their problems arise from spending too much without thought rather than going the cheap and obvious route.",3,3oicIHKU8OzAJvxRX6qNow
"5-stars for the recent visit! Just had Leshaun for the first time and she is lovely. I recommend her.... now just hoping I will be able to get her again in the future. She has many years of experience in the high end casino spas. It came through during my massage which felt like over hour but was only the 60-minute. Anna, John, Quan - some of the other therapists on their team that get my request. I tend to try out different therapists because I have an oddball schedule. So glad I have met and added another one and will be requesting Leshaun again. 

Also, this location seems like they stay on top of keeping good folks on their roll call, unlike some other locations in Las Vegas. I appreciate that and that they have friendly receptionists who seem to try to make a good fit when scheduling.",5,6sBWMx5U-q-9W2_BIc8k1A

"Such a horrible experience in buying a car.  I have bought many cars and this dealer is the epitome of shady used car sales. I looked at Prius V due to the price hanging from the rearview mirror.  When the salesman Chris C came out he said, oh that is not the correct price and told me it was $6000 more. I did not buy because I wanted to think about it longer since the price was drastically different.  I went back a week later and the car was still there with the adjusted price in it. I asked if they could go a little lower on the price.  He asked me to sign the quote if I bought it that day. I did.  He came back and he did not go as low as I wanted but was close.  I decided to go with the car.  He put all the papers together and gave my paperwork to the finance guy, Stratos. I told them I didn't have the title for my car but that I could bring it in.  Stratos said that was fine, it wouldn't make a difference.  I could take home the Prius and leave my trade in there. I brought the title at 9am the next morning. IT ACTUALLY DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I looked at my paperwork and they did not include the trade so I was charged tax on the entire transaction over $900 more, not the tax that they quoted me.  They also did not sell me for the agreed on price.  When I went back in to question this, ironically, no one could find the quote that I signed.  It miraculously has disappeared. When questioning the tax they said it was because I didn't have the title.  We asked to speak to the manager, TJ, and he wouldn't meet with us.  Instead, they said Statos out that said he works a lot of deals and we got a good deal.  He said that the quoted price was also not given since I didn't have the title when I did the paperwork.  Again, IT ACTUALLY DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE. It was a loss of over $1400.  He said that they did the paperwork right away to secure the car for me. It had already sat for over a week. Instead of telling me that they were changing everything, they proceeded with the paperwork without telling me. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

"Welp, we went on a wet cold rainy day!  So with that being said!  No fault of the event, but I just really wanted to go home!  We did, have a few drinks on a patio, and we did, get some hotdogs, from a vendor that was offering some special!  He was probably trying to get rid of them, since it was the last day, and it was wet rainy and cold!  But he was offering 2 for $5.00 and they were fully loaded, and they were so good! Then I decided to run over to the funnel cake truck, and I got the carmel one!  OMG, OMG it was amazing! After we gobbled up the funnel cake we had to go, it was too cold!  There aren't nearly as many vendors as it use to be in the past!  I know there charging them an arm and a leg to have a booth out there.  Maybe if the head honcho lowers the price a bit, they will have more vendors!  IJS But I will always go to at least 1 day during this event!  It's good to have so many vendors in 1 spot!",4,wm5atV8CLkal9t4sYpOd4g
"Update: After my somewhat favorable review, I've lowered the rating after staying here this past weekend. My friends and I decided to leave after one night b/c our room developed this ""pee"" smell -- which made us rename the place, the Imperial Pee-lace. 

However, I do need to mention our friends had the room next door and didn't have a pee-problem. The people in my room insist that no one peed on the floor, but now I'm beginning to wonder....

Original Review: 
Okay, so the Imperial Palace is definitely not the swankiest, nor the newest, nor the funnest place to go in Vegas. But it has one kitschy, old Vegas thing going for it - the Dealertainers. Don't get me wrong, it's not for everyone, but I love it. After a while, all those new places start to feel the same, look the same. The Dealertainers are black jack dealers that are tier 2 (okay maybe 3) level impersonators. They all deal cards and take turns going up on the mini stage to belt out songs - mental note, look for the speakers and DON'T sit in front of them. I had the pleasure of playing cards with Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder, Debbie Harry, Louis Armstrong, Billy Idol, and someone who may have been a very bad Mariah Carey (it was unclear). Anyway, go there for a different twist on cards - they had $5 minimum tables on a Saturday night - which is a rare find on the strip.",4,RYfYrkLoZWGWIjjf0L8awg
The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because Kendall is one of the most amazing associates. She always handled my apartment issues right away. Kendall always has a smile on her face and made my living experience at Bermuda a pure joy! As far as I am concerned this company is lucky to have her. She seems to be the only staff member ever working and going over and beyond for her tenants.,4,T5DEpg51h0V8aNhQtwuSKQ

"This charming bakery has gelato, coffee, and great baked goods. I had the half ice cream sandwich, with a peanut butter cookie and chocolate chocolate chip ice cream. My wife had chocolate and raspberry gelato and my friend had an ice cream cone with banana red pudding ice cream. They all were great. 

I also had a cappuccino and although I'm not a coffee specialist both the women with me assured me it was very good. 

The only critique I have of the place is that it does not have enough seating. There is only one table inside (we got it) and benches outside. On a nice day it's not bad, but even then you can't sit around and talk easily. So it's a small place, but so what, check it out and get a treat.",4,V1_y3toVJn44WYpsKJCfXg

"Go for the meat, stay for the chat you're having with the dude who makes you feel like you've known him since the early 90's. Good vibes.

The meat is really effing good, and as a former Montrealer and Schwartz's regular, my opinion carries some seriously fatty, steamed, well-seasoned weight. Although not melt-in-your mouth like Schwartz's, Corned Beef House has some of the best smoked meat and corned beef I've had outside of Habs Town.

My fave here is the Reuben, but given the tastiness of the meat, the basic Montreal and corned beef sandwiches are both highly recommended as well. Now I'm just waiting for CBH to team up with the Pizzaiolo downstairs and make a smoked meat pizza!

These dudes lose half a star as a result of a few small things: prices are JUST too high, they ditched their after-6pm deal after they moved, and their signage is just insufficient for this busy corner. I dislike that this means I have to explain their location relative to Hooters.",4,v8t7axsb_WVv221V2b3oYQ

"First of all, we waited for an hour in the cold, which is fine, cos we assumed this place is popular. What's not fine, however, was that four couples bypassed us (there were three of us), and we ended up sitting at a two-person table. Two of us had to basically squeeze into a one person spot. The seating was extremely disorganized, which probably explained why the wait was so long. Customer service was poor, no one apologized for the wait, nor for shoving us into a tiny spot. 

Food came half an hour after we were seated.

We ordered the savory french toast and croissant Benny with peameal bacon (their specials). Overall quality of food was average, definitely not worth the long wait in the cold. The side salad was good though. We also ordered two croissants cos we were starving, the plates that the croissants were served on were hot, so we thought we were getting warm fluffy croissants. However the croissants were cold and hard, guess they've been sitting in their bakery for a while.. 

Overall, poor experience with this place, food was really average, I paid 22$, which was pricy given the quality of food and service. 

(If you are getting your food packed, make sure you triple check to ensure that you are actually bringing your own food home. I went home, expecting to find my Benny in the bag, and found a half eaten chocolate cake instead. Gross!)",2,MgqX8QJGeguSuPNdlDHGeQ
"Best Vietnamese in Charlotte...hands down. I've tried a good portion of the menu so here are my thoughts. 

Appetizers
Recommended:  - tofu rolls, chicken and shrmp rolls, sauteed squid (awesome), stuffed grape leaves. 
Misses: dumplings (why get dumplings at a Vietnamese restaiurant anywy), chicken salad (average).

Pho
Just go down the list...chicken pho, tendon, tripe, flank stteak...all are phenomenal. Seasoned perfectly so give it a taste before you grab the siracha or hot chili oil. I would recommend paying the extra buck or two for additional meat - and it's easily two meals.

Bun
Another home-run...the pork meatball is out of this world...typically get that with spring roll and maybe add another meatball...whoosh!

Other
Rice dishes are really good, catfish stew/soup was awesome, vegetarian dishes are solid, etc.

Ricky and Tommy are the guys you'll encounter both in the kitchen and front of house....super nice guys, tons of experience in the business and generally care that their customers are happy (sometimes a little bit overbearing but I can live with it)! 

Don't be scared off by the neighborhood....it's worth the visit!",5,zhtxd_NCRjlEYBzCxaPkzg

"Everything in the Encore/Wynn is overpriced but at least the $15 french toast they served me at Society was pretty darn good. I loved the caramelized bananas.

"My boyfriend and I drove to Vegas at night and arrived around 5AM. We hate driving to Vegas during the day so we always drive at night- much faster! We usually stay at the Marriott Grand Chateau but decided to stay at a different hotel to save money but we could not check in due to them being booked. 
Anyways, we were exhausted and needed to crash somewhere. The Artisan was the first result on Google and they had vacancies, so we went. 
My first clue should have been that I've never heard of it. I lived in Vegas for a few months, I drive in from CA all the time. But alas, we went. 
Upon pulling in, there is literally a 15 car parking lot MAX. And it is all valet. That's cool, but the valet is nowhere to be found. No problem, we just want to sleep. We walk in, and it is something. Badly printed art is EVERYWHERE-- the walls, the ceilings. There's a fountain(????), sculptures. Interesting decor to say the least. I give this place two stars ONLY because the guy who checked us in 08/01/2017 was so nice. 
So we get checked in, we get the car sorted out, we get up the weird red elevator, and to the floor. Also super creepy. Every room is after an artist, I don't remember who ours was, but it was terrifying. The freaky paintings were not my thing. Neither are the 16559854 mismatched mirrors. Not to mention, my 6'4 250lb boyfriend had to body slam the door FOUR TIMES full force before it opened. That shit was STUCK. On the plus side, we weren't worried about being murdered with a door that difficult.  We slept with the lights on. The rooms are small and very run down. Random stuff in the sheets. We slept like planks and prayed we wouldn't get bed bugs or worse. It was super gross. We walked around in shoes the whole night. We didn't even shower. 
All in all, this may be a cool spot for partying or something, but avoid staying here at all costs. It's in a bad part of town, its nasty, and the only redeeming factor is the people who work here are all very nice.",3,3w-wpYKM0sijipmOO5lmsQ
"I visited this location today and to my delight was greeted by Maria. I did only use the drive thru so I'm unaware of the conditions indoors, but from what I experienced in the drive thru I'm sure it's spectacular.

I pulled into the drive thru and it didn't take long to hear Maria's lovely voice over the speaker box. I asked her for some time to decide on what I was looking to pick up because I wanted an assorted dozen. (Mmm)

I was given ample time to decide and did not feel rushed in the slightest. So I said I was prepared to order and Maria was there in a jiffy just as prepared if not more prepared than I to take my order. 

So I gave her my order flawlessly and she received in perfectly. I then pull up and she had my total for me at the window. We continued the exchange as any drive thru exchange would continue until the very end. 

This is where Maria really showed that she and her shop are a cut above the rest. She leans out the very narrow drive thru window risking intense sun burn and heat exhaustion in this Arizona (nearly) summer heat to ask me if I need any napkins. I was impressed with her bravery and care. I requested just one napkin because I only thought I would need one. But Maria leaves and swiftly returns with my donuts and hands them over to me and then tells me that she has given me two napkins. Turns out Maria knows me better than I even know myself. Maria, You and your gracious heart have made my day and I will surely be back. 

Thank you Maria and the entire Krispy Kreme family.",5,v7vesV7rETfM5Jz4ENNwHg

"Here's the quote from their website: ""We are always taking walk-ins but if you're in a rush and want to make sure we have a chair ready for you; so you can get in, get your hair cut and get on your way then contact us now!""

So with family in the hospital and absolutely no time to spare, I called and asked, ""Is there a chair available?"" The woman responded, ""Yes, but I can't predict when someone is going to walk in the door.""

I said, ""Can I make an appointment?"" She replied, ""Yes, when would your like a haircut?""

""As soon as possible,"" I replied. ""OK, come on in,"" she said. I immediately jumped in my car and drove the five minutes to the barber shop. I walked in the door to find both chairs filled and two or three guys waiting.

""Did I just talk to you on the phone about an appointment?"" I said. She snarled, ""I TOLD you I couldn't predict when someone would walk in the door."" So much for the appointment.

The end result is (1) the web site is obviously false, (2) the woman either doesn't understand the concept of an appointment or she is ""challenged"" by the concept of business ethics, and (3) I'm not willing to sit in chair while someone who can't handle something as simple as a promised appointment is holding something as sharp as a razor.

"DO NOT RENT FROM HERE. of course every rental car company tries to upsell you. here, they not only try to upsell you, but i was told that their insurance was mandatory, after i said i didn't want it / said i had my own. she said they don't take 3rd party insurance companies so you have to buy one of theirs which is completely false.
we also got charged for road side assistance which she didn't even mention but charged us anyways. both were optional in the contract but at time of purchase she said we needed to buy the insurance. so we came back and asked about it. we talked to the same girl she said ""there's nothing we can do about it since you left the parking lot already, if you wanted to be refunded you had to have told us instantly before you took the car."" why could we have been refunded for it but she said it was mandatory....? I DONT WANT YOUR INSURANCE. she was rude and useless when we went back. so we spoke to the manager and the manager didn't say one word, just refunded our money. i'm guessing because this happens a lot with that company, people get mad about HIDDEN FEES and the up selling. she refunded our money no problem while the other girl said they can't refund it because it's too late. it wasn't even about the money at this point it was the fact that we felt we got deceived and they were essentially ""stealing"" our money with hidden fees.
on another note, we had only one car to chose from and it was dented/scratched. not a problem, just didn't want to be in fault for it. 
will never rent here again. thanks ""Dana"" for only making us mad. just feel like this company is dishonest and will lie to your face and also add hidden fees just so they make more commission.",1,FRXLPLlPHwPflmJBSQTCyg

"My boyfriend and I recently moved and needed storage for a couple of months.  I'd never heard of Zippy Shell, but I like supporting local business over the big, national chains and I was impressed with their reviews.
 
They brought an exceptionally clean POD (shell?) to our home and left it for two days.  We had no trouble loading it.  We were actually done early, and they came back within 2 hours to pick it up after we called to tell them we were done early.
 
The guys we dealt with were polite and respectful.  They also showed up on time; that's hard enough to find in this town!  I had to get into my storage container after about a month, as I had packed a flash drive in one of my boxes and I desperately needed it.  It wasn't a problem, they got me into their storage facility (which was also very clean!) and I retrieved my thumb drive the next day.
 
All in all, my experience was great.  There were no surprises with the prices and they did exactly what they promised they would.

Great place to get watch batteries replaced.  The ladies working there are very professional and friendly.  I have never had a bad experience there.  A large inventory of inexpensive watches and expensive grandfather and musical clocks.,5,d2ZxDE7frDir9LW99fgFkA
I sent my husband into Andreoli's to get authentic ladyfingers which are generally not carried in grocery stores.  We were in the neighborhood.  I didn't think to ask my husband the price until we got home and saw that the 17 oz. package was $14.99.  Outrageous!!!  I purchased the same bag at Guido's on Scottsdale and Shea several months ago and it was $4.99.  I will never go back to Andreoli's!,1,WrnnFuL8omR2ddfGTDfRIQ
"My girlfriend and I came here for our anniversary. Chef Marlon prepared for us a 10 course tasting, delicious entrees, and amazing dessert. Also the service was great all the workers are very friendly. Perfect dinner for a memorable night!",5,DSmQVxpoYuVQc9pF8F-RYw
I love this place. Both bartenders (Christy and Christy) at Friday night are the best. The food is awesome and half price on happy hour and then happy hour breakfast which is also fantastic. This is by far one of the best bars/taverns in town. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!,5,D2CMjsuwdEDcI-uTon5D5A
"My wife and I were in Vegas this past weekend and wanted to try out the new High Roller to see what it's about. The whole area is new-ish. I'm not sure when it opened up but this was our first time here. The Linq has a lot of restaurants, bars and food shops in the area. We went with my parents as well. On the way to the High Roller, we saw they had kiosks to buy tickets closer to the strip. So we just decided to buy our tickets there to make it faster. We didn't know it at the time, but this saved us a lot of time!

When you buy your tickets through the kiosk, you get to pick a time slot of when you want to ride the High Roller. I would suggest giving yourself 20 minutes because it is still a pretty far walk just to get to the High Roller entrance and giving yourself some bathroom time.

The walkway to the High Roller entrance is where all the shops and restaurants are. There's a lot of music being played in the area. It seems like a really busy place and is a nice place just to stop by and chill.

When we got to the High Roller entrance, we saw a long line. Luckily we bought our tickets through the machine and we got to walk right through! So just a tip, purchase your tickets through the kiosk to save yourself some time. When you walk in the workers check purses/bags. Then you walk through the place. It reminds me of disneyland because of the way the lines are setup. We went on a Saturday at 9:10PM. We got really lucky cause we got to walk right through all the way to the top without waiting in any lines. They have an area to use the bathroom and buy drinks. I would suggest to use the bathroom since the ride is 30 minutes long and there's no place to go when you're in the pod. The drinks aren't that expensive. My wife and I tried the frozen drinks with some shots of alch.

You get grouped with around 20 people. The pods move continuously so you have to enter and exit pretty carefully. The pods have TVs inside that tells you how high you are and when you reach the apex of the ride. It also shows trivia and how the High Roller was made in a time lapse video. The views pretty nice, especially at night! You get to see the strip lit up. It was a super full moon that night as well. We got to see the Bellagio water show for a bit too. The pod has two seating areas. I would say the best place to go to in the pod would be the right side next to the entrance doors when you walk in. It has the best view of the strip when you reach the top. So try to make it out to that area if you can. But pretty much you can walk around the whole pod and enjoy all the views.

I would definitely recommend taking a ride on the High Roller if you're in Vegas. You can ride it during the day but try to go at night as you get to see all the lights Vegas has to offer. It was $35/person at night and cheaper during the day. Not that bad for a really good and fun experience.",4,PS8DiSk3cTf2APzza9Z9Sw
"It's fun and trustworthy with 2000 music! Get in before 11 for free cover and wait around until midnight, and then you'll have fun!",5,iwTmXBoBPJn--EpmCVILOQ
"They had improved a bit after they had been open for a while, not great but worth the cheap cost.  We went back today about a month after our last visit, and they have gone down the tubes.  The sushi was horrid (I have never seen fish cut so thin!), the roast beef was cooked to shoe leather, the grill was gone, the soup was watery, the egg rolls were tough and leathery, and there was no dim sum or dumplings at all.  I had a hard time finding anything that was edible.  Even what passed for desserts was awful.  We will not be back again.  I was shocked how busy they were, but I guess the price will bring people in regardless of how horrible the food is.",1,Y_TsPYNM9PrvYzXApBQ5ag
"Water Street's crown jewel as far as I'm concerned! This place was awesome when it was dive-y and remodeled it is damn near perfect! 

Located in a part of Henderson that isn't filled with soccer moms and Bikram yoga afficionados, Gold Mine is real Henderson...Hendertucky if you will. The beers are cold and cheap and they have hands-down the best juke box in town. No censored songs on this bad boy. But most times you won't even need its help thanks to the live bands Gold Mine regularly hosts. With their new (well new if you haven't been there in about a year) outdoor patio seating, there's more room for a stage and lots of tables and chairs, even couches, to lounge on and let your ears be rocked. 

To be blunt, the place is awesome, the people may be a little rough around the edges but they're nice and the venue has really stepped it up over the years. Get yourself a designated driver and show some love to the 'tucky.",5,g88RAgImU5NPlJKB5Emdbw
"I genuinely love coming here every time I can make it to Charlotte.

The restaurant is nestled squarely in an eclectic and laid-back arts district on the outskirts of Charlotte proper.

Their beer selection is always one of the best in the area and they always feature local and NC breweries. No-Da and Birdsong brewing are just a few blocks away from Cabo. 

Their menu selections area always packed with a wide variety of fish tacos, burritos and their new tortilla cornucopia bowl. Some excellent flavor combinations that will appease your fish taco cravings. The staff is always pleasant to talk with and the bartenders very knowledgeable about the beer selections on tap. Don't skip this place if you're on the East side of Charlotte.",5,O5vZVnsxbjhKgYbTCFcK7w
"I made an appointment based on Yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. The person on the phone listened to what I wanted with my hair and made an appt with Jenny. Long story short, she was great and listened to exactly what I liked and disliked about previous hair cuts. I love my haircut and I've gotten a ton of compliments. She also has a great personality and story. I'll be back!",5,sNRVDlXUz0qNtDVOSilXGA
"Wow, best pizza I've EVER had in Ontario!  This stacks up nicely against New York City pizza!  Nice thin crust, the dough is incredible, sauce is just right and cheese is amazing.  A little bit greasy, but not too much so, just right.  I'm a true pizza snob, my favorite pizza's are in NYC, Jersey shore & Atlanta...and now Etobicoke.  This is the only Ontario pizza in over 20 years that I've been comfortable recommending.  I find the price fair considering what you'd pay for lesser pizza's and I defy a real pizza lover not to be blown away by this place!  Good work Milano's!!!",5,RIlKyx9VJTynImEqPeoEKA
These are the best green chili breakfast burritos -perhaps even compared to New Mexico.   His green chili seasoning is just a cut above-family secret seasonings.  Really worth it even if the strip mall setting doesn't indicate it!,5,GGfibM3lSWcGargT1qvErQ
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!

This place does not know how to manage time or appointments, and the customer service is impeccable. I scheduled a 12:30pm appointment for a gel manicure so I could run over on my lunch since my office is within walking distance. I was traveling out of town after work and did not have time to visit my regular nail salon so I figured I would give this place a chance.

I walked in 10 minutes early to find that there were only three people working. There were also three of us waiting, two of which seemed to have been waiting a long time by the time I walked in. After sitting there for 40 minutes, other people who walked in after all of us waiting were taken in before me, despite me having an appointment, and the others waiting. Once all three workers finished their clients, and took on new clients, I knew I would be in for an even longer wait, so I walked out. 

Never once did they acknowledge me, the fact that I scheduled an appointment, or that I had been waiting for over 40 minutes on my lunch break. When I told them to cancel my appointment because I could not wait any longer, they acted as if they had no clue what I was talking about and never once apologize. 

Time is money, and it is very disrespectful to not be cognizant of others time. I obviously will never be returning, and will ensure that all of the ladies in my office building do not waste there time.

Such a senseless way to lose easy business...",1,tME8s4yoYidbB7eMYS6xpQ
"Ventured outside of North Scottsdale and finally made a trip down to Nook for lunch. Hubby and I were big fans on Tagan and Frank's Amaro in Cave Creek, but sadly, things went way downhill when they left :(  We were eager to see what they came up with in their new digs, and we were over the moon!

First of all, just loved the space which is designed with comfort in mind. The spacious semicircle booths which line one side of the room are fabulous. I wish more restaurants understood the concept of the booth! And the bar . . . it has plenty of seating to schmooze up to it, grab a beer, kick back and watch a game with your friends. Nook could be trendy, but it reminds me more of a real neighborhood restaurant and bar, the kind like in my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA.  

The menu is eclectic, but favors the Italian cuisine. You can choose decadent, like the Arancini, crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, with the best tasting fresh house-pulled mozzarella, or choose healthy, like the halibut tacos or albacore salad. For our first time, we chose decadent - the Arancini was delectable, and the langoustines were sweet and tender while the accompanying sauce had just the perfect bite. Hubby had the scrumptious Black Forest Ham sandwich which came with perfect fries. I couldn't resist the Gamberetti e Funghi pizza (shrimp, enoki mushrooms, parmesan and mozzarella).  I issue a challenge to anyone who says that shrimp doesn't belong on pizza!!!  Our informative and friendly waiter Jorge almost issued the same challenge to me . . . by remarking that he had only taken two orders for that pizza before and both were decidedly thrilled with their choice! The thin crust pizza was spot on . . . a melding of flavors and textures that really worked magic in my mouth. As an aside, I initially wanted to order it with gluten free crust, but they were out of it. I am not gluten-free as a medical necessity, but by choice . . . Nice to know they ""sometimes"" have it. You might want to call ahead to make sure it is available if that's important to you.

We love that the owners greet you at the door, and that they make time to check in with you, see if you like the food, have opinions, etc. They are eager to make Nook a place for you to call home and feel at home. No doubt we'll be back and bring a bunch of our friends with us!",4,U8n0CPS3LJi_yHlK8gyA5g
"I was so nervous, it's been awhile since I've been to a dentist! But when I first walked in, I was greeted by friendly front office staff and a very comfortable waiting area. I even got raffle tickets to enter the person who referred me here! (That would be my fiance so that means the prize is mine!) They supposedly just started doing that this month! *cross fingers for a new GALAXY TABLET!!* After some new patient paperwork, it wasn't long until I got called back. 

First I was greeted by a dental assistant who took x-rays of my teeth. (thank you, i forgot your name, but you didn't scratch my gums with those plastic films).

I then met Dr. Pham who was very professional and got straight to work. I was really nervous because I thought I would see the hygenist first! I didn't get a chance to brush my teeth before I walked in (lame, but I know you do it too!) So I was quite alarmed.. But turns out it wasn't so bad. Still wish I saw the hygenist first though!

So Dr. Pham read out a few things to his assistant in a dental language that I couldn't possibly understand, and then laid it out for me.. I had a few cracked fillings and cavities that needed work on. We'll schedule that up front after my cleaning.

THEN I then met the hygenist, who thankfully diligently worked on cleaning by teeth without talking to me too much. I don't understand why some people insist on talking to you when you have metal instruments in your mouth! But not here! She recommended a thicker floss and gave me a few samples.

Then I was on my way!

I think I found the right dentist! I guess they are all not so big and scary.. :)

---------------------------

This next part is after my first dental procedure appointment. I came back to fix 2 cracked fillings. I was SUPER surprised at how fast the visit was.. less than an hour! (I dunno, I haven't been to the dentist in a long time, so is that fast?)

I was also super happy that I got a chance to brush my teeth and floss first *yay!

Dr. Pham did an amazing job numbing my mouth. I felt my ears tingle! He was going to give me more numbing juice, but I respectfully declined.. I know, so brave.. I should've just taken more numbing, but I was really hungry and wanted to eat dinner as soon as possible after the appointment. I figured, the less he numbed me, the faster it'll wear off.. lol.. and I was right!

Overall the entire procedure was QUICK and PAINLESS. I had to go back, so hopefully the next procedures are just as easy.

Came here to check the place on staterday night. Really loved the place the view is amazing from the upper deck which was under expected with a cheap prices 5 bucks for vodka.

"I'd like to start off By saying that if licking your plate clean was socially acceptable I would have done it. 50 times over. 

My wife had been here twice prior to us going on a date. Once with a gf of hers and once with my mother and hers. I was really excited to go tonight, and so glad I did.

I'm very very fond of patios in Toronto. There are quite a few patios I like but this place has my favourite patio now. It's not something you'd expect, my romantic, spacious but small, modern and clean. Perfect. The inside of the restaurant is quite small too but also clean, modern and romantic. 

The service was great. We were attended to by a few different people, all of which were naturally friendly and attentive. We did not have to wait long to be seated, to get our drinks, and to get our dinner.

The food was really really good. I mean, I would have licked my plate, as I've said before. I had the gnocchi with bacon and chicken, my wife had the home made tomatoe soup and mushroom bruschetta (although oddly it didn't made together - the mushroom and lettuce was separate from the bread with cheese on it). Our meals were still great.

I think for 2 drinks, two appetizers paired as a meal and my gnocchi entree - paying $54 and change was a fair price. 

I loved it here. Can't wait to come back.",5,PxAnn4xGCvRzxakarvaHLg

"This is an update, after being a customer for so many years a recent service call turned into a nightmare I would stay away from this company. Costco should be looking into customer complaints and trust their customers with a different company. Customer phone operator is rude, average technicians at best, when some thing goes wrong due to their own fault they blame some one else and even if you contact them on their Facebook page they don't answer. They are more about selling you services and units but when I needed them to check a noise in my AC and the AC stops working during tinkering around with it they blame the thermostat that they installed in the first place. This is the short version, I sent the. A letter through their face book page for what really happened and I have yet to hear back from them. You wonder how this company is being managed.",1,t4dt7hHfwWRN7_lmVjhvog
Awesome studio to practice at if you live in Etobicoke.  I've been to many other yoga studio's in the area and this particular location is very inspiring and welcoming from the minute you walk in.  The staff are very friendly and the facilities are super clean.  I've been to other Moksha Yoga studio's in the GTA and this location is my favourite by far. Highly recommended!!!,5,Hg5f-eWFl75b8Dypt5LrkA
"I've only been here once but I plan to go back. The cocktails are delicious and the ambiance is pretty cool. I have yet to try any of the food though.

It was very nice.",4,POpOVm8Ykp2Rqa3cohW5jQ
4 stars for the beer selection. 1 star for the pizza. Service is decent. The two times I have had their pizza I was really disappointed. The crust was thick and doughy and tasted like cardboard. Very bland toppings. Good thing they had some great beers to wash it down with.,2,_e_fET7h80lgwFcqOI_5jw
"I have been here several times for facials with Christine. She does a fantastic job, the place is very nice, and the prices are reasonable. I also did eyebrow waxing with one of my facials and that was good.

The massage portion of the facial is very relaxing as well.",5,8xECeoz-5CsZp7vSr9SZkQ

"The worst pool cleaners I have ever had.  They sign you up and take your credit card number to charge your card regardless of the terrible job they do.  I have weekly service and my pool has been green and full of algae almost the entire time.  I can't use my pool as it is either full of green algae or they filled it full of some chemicals that leave a foamy residue floating on top of the water and when that goes away, my pool is green again.  They never fail to get their payment though, because they have your credit card!  Now they say after all my complaints, that I have to drain and refill my pool!  They created the problem and then want me to pay hundreds of dollars to refill my pool due to their negligence.",1,_kEC0af829Dwnh_8YGBpvA

"We've eaten here with friends several times over the past couple years.  I like their 4 cheese Mac & cheese with chicken strips.  Last night I ordered the same and found that the serving had shrunk in size by about half.  When I brought it to our servers attention, her reply was that it's always served in this bowl.  Well, yes it is...it's just not usually so little amount in the bowl.  I asked her if my dinner looked like $12.00 worth of Mac& cheese (and 3 chicken fingers).  She got the manager who 'supposed' he could get the kitchen to make some more.  I told them not to worry about it.  I don't want to sound cheap... I don't mind spending a little on my dinner... I'm just used to getting enough to take home for a lunch at work.  Not last night.  I won't be going back to this applebees. . Kinda felt like they didn't care weather I returned or not... So I wont",1,Z-yIVTGYTD6SN1QCneSJJw
"What is camp social? One might think it's an indoor kids camp or a trampoline company. We wondered too so we had to check it out. It's a restaurant mostly geared to adults with a large bar in the middle. There is outdoor seating and some cute campers on the inside. The restroom feels like a summer camp bathroom but a lot cleaner. There is a small game room in the back with a ping pong table and couch and tv. I would love them to have the movie Meatballs on the many tv screens but for the sports fan it works.
Baskets on table with squeeze bottles like when you are at a picnic.
Food was good but not impressive. I enjoyed my breakfast pizza which is great for two but too big for one. Had the leftovers the next day! Hubby liked his pork sandwich but said average in taste.

Still worth a visit to try for yourself and they even have weekend breakfast.",3,x4BPDJvgvvA6WcGKDi7SBg
"Be prepared, this place has LOUD, LOUD, LOUD music playing to the point that everyone is yelling at someone else in order to get heard. It's a joke. We sat next to a large party of six people and they were not talking, they were YELLING at each other.  And I'm not talking about normal restaurant background music, this music was boom, boom, boom music. Might as well be in a nightclub. It was very hard to have a nice conversation while enjoying our meal. Our server told us that it's like that on the weekends, NOT the weekdays. Heh, food was just okay, small portions with large $$$$. This is just another restaurant trying to be THE Italian place to go to. Your not in Naples you know, or even Rome. The menu isn't that great either, but check it out for yourself. Want something great to eat with a classy atmosphere? Check out Hugo's Cellar  in the Four Queens downtown, or if your ever in Palm Springs go to Spencer's.",3,7FjKK6CnNoWjgMJAQI7XUg
"One of the best Happy Hours I have ever been to!  The food was outstanding and the service was great!  The drinks were strong and the prices (especially for the quality) were fantastic!!

Hubby and I got there close to 4:00 on a Monday night and we were able to get a great spot with a nice view.  By 4:30, the crowd was increasing.  Our waitress was excellent!  I asked for a variation on the drink menu and not only was she accommodating, but she included it as part of the $6.00 HH drink menu!  It was a house-made Skinny Margarita (both hubby and I ordered it) and it was tasty and STRONG!  I had 2 of these delicious drinks, and that was 1 too many!  Yes, I'm a bit of a light weight when it comes to tequila, but still...it was STRONG!!  :-)

For food, we ordered Guacamole to share (YUM!!!!), hubby had the Filet Mignon Sliders with Blue Cheese (OMG, they were divine!!) and I had the seared Ahi tuna.  The Ahi was good, but it felt weird to eat it with a fork....I have NEVER eaten Ahi without chopsticks.  Sac-religious of sorts.  

This ended up being our dinner because it was so filling and satisfying.  Two of us ate fantastic food (to include quality Filet Mignon and Ahi) and we had 3 kick-butt drinks for under $35!!!!   That's a GREAT deal!!!

If it hadn't been for the fact that it was 110 degrees, we would have enjoyed the lovely outdoor area.  I hope that our travels bring us back here in the winter!!

I posted a few pictures, but I need to apologize for the fuzziness of the Ahi pic...I was on my second Margarita by that time!  LOL",5,riNE9V496zEAYEu80AYQsA
"This place is an absolutely gem. The food is amazing ... As is the service, the decor and the coffee .... THAT COFFEE ... Wow!

"50 minutes is how long it took to get my very first drink. And that was after getting up to grab my own glass of water 10 minutes prior.  My food took one hour and 25 minutes before it arrived. When my food arrived, the accompanying side dish wasn't even the one I ordered.

There seemed to be a complete absence of any managers or owners who were overseeing the place. Shame on the owner or manager because you would have noticed there was a problem if you were doing your job.  This is YOUR fault!  No one else's.  If you are the owner, sell the business to someone who cares. If you are the manager, I hope the owner tells you to seek employment elsewhere.

The few good things were that the food was excellent (and hot in spite of the delay).  Carl, whom I don't even think was our waiter, was very attentive when he realized on his own that there was a problem at our table. (We never complained, however). And our waitress was very sweet and very apologetic (although not very attentive during the course of the evening).",1,LttInZ934Etht3nlweSOGw

We ordered apple gorgonzola salad, baked ziti, penne san remo, chicken parmigiana and for dessert... Tiramisu.  Large quantity while keeping the quality to the highest standard.  The chicken parmagiana was a huge hit by our guests.  First item to run out. Penne san remo was popular as the ingredients were fresh and the dish was savory.  By far of of my favorite dishes at Buca. Vegetarians enjoyed the baked ziti. Salad fresh and crisp.  Combination of ingredients explode with the perfect balance.  Tiramisu ran out in 10 minutes once placed on the table.  Should have ordered more.

I've used hertz a lot in the past.   However today when I showed up they were trying out a new system.   They give you a pager and you get to wait for them to buzz you.   This is really slow.   Agents would sit idle for minutes at a time while people would come from who knows where with a buzzing pager.   This caused much longer wait times.  It was silly.   A guy there who looked like a manager of some sort told me they were trying it out and he was taking notes.   It took three employees to run the paging desk none of whom were taking care of customers.   Waste of time and money.  A sign that there are major leadership issues at Hertz.,2,cBhl6-_wOfmf-lFVM3SNfg

Cue Club has become a Mill Avenue staple in recent years. Every notable Tempe establishment has its own respective day in which it is best to attend. For Cue Club that day is without a doubt Sunday. The seemingly endless long islands and cheap drinks on Sunday make for an excuse to get absolutely plastered. They have pool tables and a few bar games in the back so you're not forced to converse with the people you came with. It is a great way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon and forget the responsibilities that come with the week ahead.,4,c85nAZ3SvASW8mZBLoVkVA

"If there was an option, I would have given 2.5 stars. But the reason I chose 2 instead of 3 is because their selection of Assam teas, lemon tea and the customer service was good. They were welcoming and gave off a Guam vibe. 
 
We ordered the Hafa Adai plate and Beef plate then sat down. It took about 15-20 minutes to receive our food. First of all, they gave us the BBQ chicken plate instead of the Beef plate we ordered. Upon opening the box, we were hoping it to be fresh and hot because it took quite a bit of time to ""cook"" but it was just warm food. 

The red rice overall was a pretty good recipe but I've had better. The texture and tenderness of the chicken kelaguen was good but I felt like they completely overpowered it with lemon, as if I was eating a lemon warhead. Comparing the two plates and the given the price, the portions of meat given was small. On top of that, the meat lacked flavor, was not tender and poorly marinated. The filling of the empanada seemed to be drenched in oil and greasy. The thing I did enjoy was the finadene, which added flavor to the main entree meat. 

Overall the service was something I did expect in Guam. A very genuinely nice ambiance. The owners as well as their employees were very kind and hospitable. It made me feel like I was back on the island!  

If they were able to focus just more on the flavor and taste of the food, they would have a very good restaurant. To sum it all up the food was okay, but the Guam vibe made up for the experience! The restaurant has a lot of potential and I'd be willing to give this place another chance.",3,1Te48puqa793DuKkb65DkQ
"Just like any other IHOP but brand spanking new.  They have some kinks to work out, but overall decent.  VERY friendly and they are extreme on their cleanliness, which is a plus in my book.  I'm happy so far and will probably return in a February to see if they've worked out their kinks.

Parking is a bit on the small side.",4,L1PSYEIb4RQKi0NthU-_Fg
My husband and I had guests from out of town and we brought them here for breakfast. The food is simply amazing. I've been to there other locations too but the one inside the Linq casino tasted a lot better. The chorizo with eggs and potatoes are sooooooo good!! If you are staying at the Linq you must check out this place! Its super good. We had reservations but it took about 40 minutes for our food to come out. They were super busy so it wasn't an issue for us. The customer service was wonderful too. Make sure you come hungry because the portions are HUGE! =),5,-gn-URWUEfR-Lh8LmGYZgQ
"Came here on a rainy Friday night and left super satisfied!  I had read about this place already and being that it's from the same owner that brought us La Carnita where the wait for a table is sooooo long, we called ahead to ask how long we can expect to wait for a table of two.  They said 30 minutes which we thought was ok so we walked over.  When we got there, we were able to snag two seats at the bar immediately (we were starving) so was pretty happy with that!

I'm always a bit wary of the pretentiousness of the joints in King West but Home of the Brave was refreshingly cool and low-key, not to mention quite reasonably priced considering its location and the quality of the food.  Our bartender/server was really friendly and she offered good recommendations for drinks and food.  Our food was served promptly and our glasses were always kept full.

We had the chicken handshake sandwich, fried bologna sandwich, lobster roll, and red velvet funnel cake (all shared, but a bit tricky to split the sandwiches which were generously stuffed).  All winners, but my favourite was the chicken handshake sandwich.  Having been pretty much raised on dim sum, the fried chicken foot didn't bother me one bit.  The fried bologna sandwich was delicious (not what you brought to school as a kid), with a generous serving of bologna on a soft eggy bun.  The lobster roll was also really tasty.  To be honest, we were full from our sandwiches, but the call of the red velvet funnel cake easily overcame my weak weak defense against dessert.  It was super tasty (though a bit too sweet for my tastes) and less greasy that what you'd find from a stand at Wonderland.  Came garnished with fresh berries which made me feel a tiny bit better about eating deep fried dough and sugar.

Would definitely come back here again...the rest of the menu looks pretty interesting and if our first visit was any indication, it should be really good too!",4,Lqd01EhCvUKrTlGRkdf4VA
"Made reservations months ago for two suites for a bridal party. Confirmed all details three times leading up to the date. When the ladies were checked in they were shown to the wrong size suite.  That was soon corrected.  Was told making original reservations that they had to be paid for in advance because of special rate.  Upon check in my card would not go through so they charged the someone in the wedding party's card. They had to come find me to get the charges off and put on correct card.  I had my number stolen and credit card company closed that card and issued me a new one. I didn't think it mattered since they TOLD ME I WAS PAYING IN ADVANCE and I was under the impression it was done months before.  On the plus side, absolutely beautiful decor and very polite staff. 
    We also arranged for Rehearsal Dinner in their restaurant, La Plancha. This was in a lovely side alcove area with special table arrangement and menus.  Lynzee did an awesome job. The food was fantastic. The service was incredibly slow.  It was embarrassing. They were bound and determined to hold off dinner and appetizers until they could run up the open bar tab for several hundreds of dollars. They did apologize. It took maybe an hour for any food to hit the table.  I had to get up and ask them to clear away empty appetizer platters after they sat there.  There were no other customers in the restaurant all night. 
    After all the hotel charges had stopped pending, I found I was confused since it just stated ""lodging"" for each charge. I wanted to go over a more detailed bill so I called hoping to speak to a billing department since it was more than I estimated. I was told I could speak to the manager Shaun and he would help.  I left a voice mail, and it's been a few weeks.  He did not return my call. Disappointing experience.",3,R_2O0QEKy3ag98S05JH9Xw

"Back in 2009 when Don and I were just dating, I kept telling him about a ""Cosplay Lounge"" that was opening up in Vegas. I never got around to going and soon forgot about it because it didn't gain much popularity (nothing even pops up when typed into Yelp). Forward almost three years later and Don was taking me on a ""surprise"" lunch date. He parked at Monte Carlo and I had no idea where we were going. I never even knew where the Cosplay Lounge was located, so that's totally not what I was expecting. We turned the corner and he said, ""This is it!"" and I was still confused, because it said ""Dragon Noodle Co."" which didn't ring a bell at all. That's when said, ""It's the Cosplay Lounge!""

We walked past the completely empty lounge area and into the restaurant where there were only two other people dining. The waiter brought out our menus and told us there were currently lunch specials and dim sum. I noticed Don looking around all disappointed and he told he he was confused because he expected to at least see someone dressed in costume, but not a single person was. When the waiter came back, Don asked him about the ""Cosplay Lounge"" and the waiter gave him this extremely puzzled look like he had no idea what he was talking about. So Don started describing it and talking about the costumes and the guy said, ""Ooooh, that's not all the time. It's just at night on weekends."" By the way he answered, it sounded like he was even unsure of that. I have a feeling they don't even do the ""Cosplay"" thing anymore, but I could be wrong. 

After getting over the whole situation, we went ahead and ordered two lunch specials: Mongolian Beef ($9.95) and Orange Chicken ($9.95). Both came w/ soup, rice, and a Spring roll. On top of that we also ordered Salt & Pepper Calamari ($8.25) and Steamed Pork Siu Mei ($3.50). The Calamari was very different. It didn't come with any sauces and it came on a bed of lettuce with onions and jalapenos on top. We both really enjoyed it. Rather than relying on the sauce for the flavor, the dry toppings gave it all the flavor it needed and the jalapenos were a nice little kick. The Orange Chicken was alright, nicely breaded and cooked. The Mongolian Beef, however, was WAY TOO SAUCY. This pic I took: http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/deeOpEHwPHQpXvF7YYPIcA/l.jpg doesn't even detail the amount of sauce that was on it because the lighting was poor. It was like someone was having a water balloon fight in the kitchen, except with water balloons filled with sauce and one of them accidentally landed and exploded on top of my Mongolian Beef. I just stuck to everything else on my plate and picking off Don's plate. 

Overall, the two things I liked about this place were the ambiance and the Calamari. The service wasn't that great. The waiter only refilled our water once and that was when we asked him to do so when he brought out the bill. The only thing that would bring me back would be the Calamari and I'd probably order it to-go.",1,YXtXTR1IfTgjKPIq0fcSaw

"I checked in here for lunch today. I usually do not use that function because I have a baby and a special needs 3-year-old so just to go out to eat at all is a pretty big undertaking.  Instead, I typically do my reviews afterwards from my desktop computer at home.  This time, our older child was not with us so I thought I'd try ""checking in"" for a change.  Much to my surprise, a 10% off offer just for checking in appeared on my phone!  CooL! When I showed it to the server,  I asked if I needed to let him know about it before ordering or at the conclusion of our meal he stated,  ""We can do it now. No problem.""  

He was very attentive, brought our drinks promptly, and even brought refills before our drinks were half empty. The food was served pretty quickly and was good. 

When the bill came, the 10% had not been taken off.  Another gentleman came to accept payment.   Therefore, I had to explain the. Whole Yelp thing over again to him which was kind of annoying. Also took a very long time for someone to come take my payment.  We had been ready to leave for a while and needed to go pick up our other son.

"this place is pretty nice. very clean and minimalistic furniture and atmosphere. The service is very friendly. the thing I absolutely love about this place is the menu. 

LET ME TELL YOU! it seriously serves a very VERY limited amount of different dishes. Their specialty is obviously topoki so they have one page where you get to create your own topoki dish ranging from type of sauce, meat, and carbs that goes with it. another page is where the snacks are and then they have another page for specialty rice bowls. they also have a selection of drinks as well. 
I'm pretty sure that with every item combined on the menu... there's probably just about 20 items or so... prices are pretty good. 2 main dish with a snack was about $36 without tips. 

Recommendations: 

Popcorn chicken snack: very well done in terms of crispiness and flavour. comes with 2 sauce: wasabi mayo and some spicy red sauce i forgot the name to.

Bulgogi kimchi cheese rice: rice on bottom and bulgogi on one side and kimchi on the other side with melted cheese on top of everything, sprinkled with seaweed. Let me warn you... this kimchi is abnormally spicy for some reason... STILL AMAZING though. 

Topoki with choice of red sauce, seafood, and ramen: this sauce is pretty spicy compared to the ones you're used to in normal Korean restaurants. It definitely does not have that hint of sweetness you're so used to. If you can't handle spicy... i suggest you choose a different sauce because you will definitely feel it a couple bites in.",3,mlncne73mxiodaP3b0Da2A

"Two caveats: 1, it is amazing and baffling that the near east side has no real mexican food, and 2, I get that people like margaritas, and that a kid-friendly restaurant (where the parents can drink said margaritas) is bound to have a built-in clientele.

That said, how the hell does this place stay in business?  
I ate dinner there about a month ago, and the generally shabby quality of the food amazed me. The taco meats were dry and saturated with sugar (something I've noticed at other FF restaurants too), the tortillas were verging on stale, and the salsa bar, while always a good sign, contained exactly one edible salsa. 

Trying to stuff some calories in the ol' pie hole and get back to work, I doused my tacos in green Tabasco from the bottle on the table. 
Problem? It was horribly rancid, and the waiter I informed of this apparently didn't know that hot sauce can go rancid. I literally threw 3/4 of my meal in the trash can. 

Maybe they should spend less on their kitschy decor and more on the food. If you want Americanized Tex-Mex, go to Pasquals or Burrito D. If you want actual Mexican food, go to the south side.",2,xJF5I-ksgQNEwTm3cDHB6A

"18 days without air conditioning and 32 days without a properly working zone control. Do I honestly need to say anything else?  

Like most people, the only reason I got mixed up with AZ Trademasters was because they were assigned to me via my home warranty (One Guard). The problem I encountered was that my AC was not blowing cool air, while also short cycling (turning on and off every few minutes). A technician came out rather quickly and determined that I needed a new zone control sensor. My issue wasn't covered under warranty, so I was quoted an out of pocket cost for the repair. Seeking reassurance, when I spoke to the owner, he confidently said that this part would fix my issue.

Guess what? It didn't.

I contacted them a second time. Another technician comes out, having absolutely zero back-story on the current situation. After filling him in, they determined that I now need a new zone control board. This also isn't covered under my warranty and will result in an even bigger out of pocket cost. But that's okay, as I was, once again, assured that this part would fix my issue.  

Guess what? It didn't.

After two failed attempts to fix my unit, the AC continued to not work, forcing me to contact them a third time. By now, we're passed the point of ridiculous. Unable to provide me with answers, they instead decided to ""research"" the issue with my manufacturer to see just exactly what could be going on. I'm sorry, but I don't have time to just sit around for several days waiting for repair people to ""research"" my issue.

While all this was going on, I decided to seek out a second opinion. Within a matter of hours, someone came out and very quickly diagnosed the ""lack of cool air"" issue, which was the result of a bad TXV.  And guess what? It just so happens to be covered under my warranty. Oops! I guess the techs at AZ Tradmasters overlooked this?

They eventually did the repair, although the owner explained that I still needed additional work done on my zone control, pointing out that my unit was in need of a specific valve. I was supposed to receive a quote for the additional repair, which I requested multiple times. I never received it. Then again, after two failed fixes and such terrible communication, do you honestly think I'm going to let them do anything else to my unit?  

I called my warranty company and demanded that they send out another company (Cool Blew). Guess what? The valve that they claimed that I needed was there all along! It was just well hidden and not properly set up. A few adjustments, a couple of thermostat modifications, and guess what? My AC and zone control system works. No new parts, no guess work, and no research needed. Thank goodness I didn't get duped for a third unnecessary repair.

Overall, I had a very bad experience with these people. Communication was extremely poor.  The only one who has any idea of what's going on is the owner, and even his communication was on the shoddy side. I usually had to call my warranty company, who would then, in turn, call them for me - as they obviously need to remain on their good side.

Because this company was assigned to me, I had unresolved issues for over a month! If the right repair company was assigned to me in the beginning, my issues would have been resolved within a matter of days, not weeks!

Bottom line: If you're a One Guard Warranty customer and you have an issue, request that they send another company out to look at your AC. After my horrid experience, there's absolutely no way in hell I'd ever let these people near my AC ever again.   

Stay away!",2,8ONiw5x7l8h7GHo-P535OA

"This place reminds me of the Philippines...in a bad way.  I'd like to lead off with this disclosure: I love to visit the Philippines, it's a mostly gorgeous country, and the people are top notch. With that stated, my experience with businesses in the Philippines is pretty consistent: ""the customer is always wrong"".  This was also my experience at Pancit Adobo.

I ordered the Arroz Caldo to try the breakfast dish.  For $4.99, you get a delicious soupy rice and chicken dish and coffee.  Well, that's what you are supposed to get.  Instead, I was given a different Arroz Caldo meal (about $6.25) and was charged an extra $1.00 for the instant coffee.  I decided to discuss the matter with the person at the cash register.  The discussion went nowhere.  I then used a visual aid...the restaurants advertised breakfast special that was hanging on the wall.  With my finger, I pointed at their advertisement.  I was told that even though the sign said ""$4.99 breakfast includes coffee"" and Arroz Caldo was the very first item listed, it was really the dishes that were under the Arroz Caldo that were for $4.99.  What???

I liked the Arroz Caldo.  It was freshly cooked.  The coffee was fine.  Most of the dishes they offer are pre-cooked, out on display.  If you like your Filipino food fresh, this may not be the place for you.  If you like businesses that honor their own advertised prices, this may not be the place for you.  If you long for the experience of ""the customer is always wrong""...you've struck gold here.",2,5muaqm8RoqUq4liAaCqz2g
"I was a fan - the turkey leg and greens were outstanding, however a friend just told me they were closed.   I called their number, and it is no longer in service.   Hopefully, this is a temporary situation.",2,hes9FwP6IN31FsnExHzYbQ

"I had been urged to come here several times by friends, for whom this is their go-to place for a Mexican food fix.  Finally, they simply took me here.  I didn't know what to expect in a remote area of town that was previously unknown to me.  I just ordered my favorites, and let the chips fall where they landed.

In this case an abundance of warm tortilla chips freshly made in house landed on my table in a woven basket, along with hot sauce and a bean dip, just after I had sat down--on a super-hard, wooden seat.  The chips and dipping alternatives were welcome sights for this hungry diner.  Soon two orders of guacamole joined this array, and I quickly forgot about my hard seat.  

The homemade guacamole was cool and creamy, but it still retained a few small lumps and tiny pieces of tomato.  If it contained any sour cream, it was not enough for me to notice.  The hot sauce was good and tasty, with medium-level spiciness.  The bean dip, slightly salty, was mild and addictive.  The chip basket was emptying fast, as one after the other worked their way to my mouth.  Service was excellent, as my water and Sprite were replenished without request, and I was even asked to hand over used paper napkins during the course of dining, so new ones could be immediately supplied.  I don't know if this was the regular level of service or influenced by my photo and note taking inside the restaurant.  But it was stellar service.

I ordered a Burrito Mojado, a wet carnitas burrito covered with Enchilada Sauce and a smattering of guacamole, that I suspected would be too large for me to finish in one sitting.  And I was right--especially because I ordered it with an a la carte Shredded Beef Taco.  The burrito, which was filled with carnitas, beans, and rice, was a bit salty but otherwise tasted great.  The Enchilada Sauce over melted cheese was mild, which is what I prefer.  I ate and enjoyed a little over half of the gigantic burrito that arrived before me, and packaged the remainder for a follow-up lunch.    

The taco in a springy, mostly hard corn tortilla, as ordered, tasted good, but I was quite disappointed that, although it contained adequate amounts of shredded beef, lettuce, and shredded cheese, this taco was sans tomato.  I often pay extra to make sure that I get tomatoes in my tacos, but this time decided that I would just eat what was presented to me as is.  I was surprised that the taco tasted as good as it did while lacking tomatoes, but still would have preferred some cool, red vegetation in that taco.  

Non-Mexican fare did not fare that well on this outing.  Diane's ordered Cheeseburger ran into serious trouble.  In two tries at medium-rare, the kitchen first produced a patty that was beyond well done, and then another that was simply well done.  And the forlorn patties each looked to be no thicker than 1/8 of a pound.

The restaurant had a display case that contained a Chocolate Cake, Red Velvet Cake, Carrot Cake, Cheesecake, and Lemon Cake that all looked pretty good.  So, I ordered a slice of Lemon Cake for sharing.  And, it was cold, imbued with the flavor of lemon, and pretty darn good!

Casa Don Juan has a nice, festive atmosphere with some interesting touches, like several pictures and photos of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo on a dedicated wall.  This is Old Las Vegas, South of the Border style.  And, based on what I ate and experienced here, I intend to return.",4,18-pMZyseUvVLbocLo0Jjg
Had the red neck tacos at the Big Red Night of the Dead concert. These were amazing. I will absolutely stop by the Chandler location to get some more and try the ribs.,5,KA9nfAvtZwtwUJsGtEMAhA
"With the restaurant being close to the strip and UNLV, I was a little surprised that it was relatively empty the times that I went. The lunch specials are such a good deal considering what you get for an affordable price (choice of entree, soup, and rice). The owners are really friendly and it's clear that they put a lot of effort towards the food and service.

It's good to know that I can get authentic Chinese food near where I live and the location is excellent. The only issue I have with the restaurant is that I wish parking was more accessible. From the times that I've been here so far, it seems like a toss up as to whether or not you get a decent parking spot near the restaurant. Other than that I do recommend Mr. Beijing as they really do cook up some great food daily!",4,cQGIZxNDja4do3WWnHG31g
"$14.25 Pepporoni Pizza was not made to order (kept warm by a heat lamp).

"This place was really amazing! I went here for the first time today with friends (four ppl) and we decided to get a tempura appetizer, Gyoza dumpling appetizer and a $63.00 party tray that's suppose to feed 6 people I believe. 
Everything was really amazing! The assortment of sushi and sashimi was great and the ingredients were top notch. After splitting the bill with tax and 15% tip (that I chose to add) it was $25.01.",5,U30562ldv6YOkLdhnphZAQ
"5 stars, no question! The quality was incredible. Ever bite you are reminded of what food should taste like - natural and healthy, leaving you energized and feeling great. I had the grass fed burger with sweet potatoes and kale salad. I usually hate Kale, but the lemon juices and seasonings made it super tasty! The rest of the day I felt good and wasn't tired. 

I walked through the kitchen and they have people peeling carrots, washing lettuce, cutting squash, etc. 

I'll definitely be back and sharing this with my friends and family.",5,zxk7OGsEuPujvRtAvOf9XA
"Their food is amazing, and so good. But I have to say service is really not that good. WE booked a reservation for 6:30pm and we didn't get seated until well after 7pm. IN general service was quite slow. We ordered two orders of the peking duck - the duck is quite well roasted and the skin was crispy, so i would have to say for what they are known for, it was delivered up to standard. I also liked their toppings becuase it's more than just the celery,cucumber and carrot that usually goes with it. WE also ordered this rish dish and it was AMAZING. It literally came in a RICECOOKER lol... the waitress mixed in the sauce and evyerthing but oh my gosh that rice was so tasty and delish! BEcuase of the huge wait and being so crazy busy and the seating atmosphere isn't the greatest, I would come back eventually, but i'm not dying to come back, the food was great, i just wish their service was better.",3,c9X-17bdzwXLDwXYzqpd9g

I love the feel of a different ""type"" of  mountain to climb.My husband and I usually climb  Thunderbird Mountains  or Camelback. This was different with a  gravel path  instead of a large rocky path. The  hike is also unique that it is a turnaround versus a point to point hike. 

Watch out for the variety of people .The path is narrow and some people are unaware of the need to move over for faster climbers.",5,2RHPei64VfrxQ9QaIib1OA

Cosmo park is great and a good idea for Gilbert. We use to take our dog Gidget there all the time but she gets to nervous around other dogs and it was causing he lots of stress. But the facilities are nice. Especially now that they have a timid dog area. The only downfall is lots of the dog owners are borderline retarded and don't watch their dogs to make sure they behave which has caused problems almost everytime we have gone. But overall a great place to take your pooch.,4,OEytne2IN8Ut9gMcmy0Nxg
"We decided to have an EARLY start to our day and were looking for a place to eat stuff like EGGS and BACON to give us a boost of protein.

We planned to get to the pool first before the crowds.

So we took the tram-thing over to The Coffee Shop next to Pho in TI and the menu was just like what we were looking for. Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Potato, Toast, Pancake.

But then a quick breakfast pit stop became a LONG and drawn out morning with minimal and very poor service by ladies in a very bad mood. It was not even that early! Like, 9am! Come on! They were so bitchy and unfriendly and had the most sour looks ever! I know this is not Disney Land, but do you have to make it a bitchfest so early in the morning???

People came into the cafe and then people who came in AFTER us started to get their food BEFORE us. It was not complicated food we had ordered. And Egg is and Egg really. You just crack it into a pan and watch it fry up and throw the hashbrowns onto the oil and whatever.

The bitchfest was contagious and we started to get bitchy and restless too, starting to join the mood of our servers. When the table that had the baby at it got their food at the same time as us - but had come in the restaurant an HOUR after us -- that was THE LAST STRAW.

We ate in bitchy silence fuming, having waited like 2 hours for a simple meal of Eggs. And the hashbrowns were tasteless and limp. Even I can make better hashbrowns than that.

To top it all off, the waitress LIED on the bill about what time we actually came in the restaurant, putting down a time, like, 45 minutes later.

I exited to the casino (and got hit on by a disgusting drunk man) while my friend bitched it up to the manager. 

So we got some discount. But we couldn't bring back all that extra time we wasted sitting in that blah place on the hard chairs in the middle (not even a booth), with growling stomachs and missing swimming pool time.

Another bridge burned in Vegas...",2,WbXWl6mFOgC4knx2VZQBdg
"The price tag for the Jimmy Dean Delights turkey sausage bagels said $5.99.  After I got home, I looked at the receipt and noticed I was charged $7.19.  Thanks for the false pricing, Target.  I think that's illegal, too.

"I don't know why people rate it highly. I went to this after the good rating from yelpers but found it so,so. I ordered the meatball sandwich after the server raved about their daily made mozzarella cheese and the meatballs.
However, the meatballs were quite bland. I asked for some marinara sauce to give it some flavor. You would think that an Italian restaurant would have some readily available but no. Took about 10 minutes to get some.",2,wI4OfjbTZo8Jmdf3-489sw
"Lions, Tigers, and Dolphins oh my!

We got these tickets as part of the 3 for $57 deal. Ethics of keeping animals caged aside, the big cats were fun. They were up and playing around just like house cats. One had a ball he was happily rolling around. A black leopard was snoozing away on a rock reminiscent of my pint sized black cat snoozing away. It was hard to get a decent picture and there were lots of kids around. This is, as far as I could tell, one of the few kid friendly options on The Strip. 

The dolphin pool was a bit strange. They had a series of gates to keep certain ones contained. Perhaps if I asked one of the trainers, I would have gotten an explanation.",4,XcGrY0CfsWkJ-GvzD2Qi2w
"I started taking both of my cars here - a Nissan 370Z, and a Nissan Juke.  So far I've used him for oil changes, tint, and a couple of new tires.

This isn't a big chain or anything like that. Wassek is the guy who runs it, and he seems to really care about his customers, and understand the importance of good service and knowing what's going on. He offers a variety of services, like I said, so I think you could pretty much bring your car here for whatever you want - routine stuff, or fancier things.

The most important thing I look for in a mechanic is somebody who I don't think is going to try and screw me, and while that's not always an easy thing to determine, Wassek is always to-the-point, and seems like an honest fellow. He could have tried to sell me 4 tires when I needed 2 new ones, and he didn't. He's never tried to upsell me on anything. I appreciate that - just keep me on the road, man, you know?

The second most important thing to me is communication - specifically around timelines. Some mechanics will be like, ""Hey I'll call you when it's ready"" which is a load of crap. Wassek said my oil change would be fast, and I was in and out of there in like, 15 minutes. Nice. He said he'd order the tires, and have them installed by like, 1 or something, and he gave me a call before 1 and let me know it was done and to come pick them up. Stuff like that makes it so I can keep living my life while my car is being worked on and I don't have to put everything on hold while I wait.

The waiting area is nice and clean and cool, and he's got wifi, and a camera setup so you can kind of watch them while they work on the cars. This place is also near a bunch of stores, so if you wanted to walk across the street to McDonalds or some fancy hippy cafe while you wait, that'd be easy.

I'll be going back.",4,Ra3j6Yep_8n3Cf_GDusnVw
"Terrible Caesar's Entertainment Property - Will Not Be Back

We just returned from a Birthday trip for my daughter... we had four rooms at Bally's. The two rooms that were in the ""old tower"" were entirely unacceptable. They were not only old and tired but filthy and in total disrepair. One room even had a bloody hand print on the wall! Dirty linens, stained carpets, marred furniture, stained bathroom amenities, the list is long. We went to the front desk to see about changing a room and were told they were totally sold out so no other rooms available. Then, when I offered a tip, the nice young lady said, ""well I can probably find one but it will be an extra $75 per night"". When I told her that was ridiculous, considering they were already paying $250 per night, she kindly reduced the upgrade fee to $40 per night. How funny that she miraculously found a room! Extortion just like the old Mob days!

We had our choice of two free rooms at any Caesar's property and chose Bally's only because it was less expensive for those who had to pay. We will never make that mistake again. You could not pay me to stay there again.

The gambling was the worst I've experienced in my 30 years of experience. I don't expect to get rich but a simple return once in a while would have been reasonable. I didn't believe the horrible gambler reviews online about this place buy now I understand and agree.

The only decent thing about this hotel is its location. However, there are so many better choices in the area and price range. One bright spot - A couple of the staff members were very nice, particularly the lady at the Diamond Desk.

Do yourself a favor... choose somewhere else! We couldn't have been more disappointed.",1,Hzrexr3Lc-z50zz7zqYdmg

The atmosphere is pretty bare-bones, which is nice.  A long picnic table, some bar tables and some covered outdoor seating that I cannot wait to try.  It was COLD in there, my husband wore his coat and I used mine as a blanket... 

The service is friendly.  The crowd, as usual for NODA, is ecclectic and fun, friendly and non-pretentious.  They also offer a 1/2 gallon fill-up to go, or to enjoy on-site, which was a great price at $14.

They had several sauce options, all okay, but none made me say ""wow"". Sweet potato fries were a little underdone and soggy for my taste. Their new schedule is frustrating - when I go for BBQ, I'm generally looking for ribs, but they offer ribs only for 2 hours on Friday evenings.  (What's up with that?!!)

The Stem burger is what you get when breakfast runs face first into an organic beef patty.  It's a burger with a fried egg on it...with bacon topped with a tomato and garlic mayo.

The onion rings were a perfect side, gigantic and crunchy.

"Robinson Ranch is tucked away on the side of the mountain in a quiet little suburban neighborhood. Pulling up, you wouldn't expect it to be as massive as it is, but first impressions mean nothing before you step through its gates.

Robinson Ranch is owned and operated by Mr. Robinson, who teaches riding classes, hosts therapy sessions, and hosts riding clubs that partake in activities from parades, funerals, and I'm also pretty positive civil war reenactments. 

The ranch is large and they have over 20 horses (several who were loaned/borrowed out at the time I visited). They also had pigs, sheep (I saw 3 that were born the same day, so cute!), and other animals you'd expect to find on a farm. Each type of animal had a clean enclosure with plenty of food and water and a great amount of space. People who treat animals properly are the people you want to support.

Mr. Robinson has a gang of volunteers that help in every aspect of the ranch and he is always looking for more. If I lived in the area I would definitely sign up. He screens every applicant and has every volunteer do orientation.

I cannot say enough wonderful things about this ranch. You should look them up if you're in the area and want to take a riding class or join a riding club.",5,UU9rRZiYU4T4PqLQZf055w

"I had heard amazing things about Inspire before coming, and I am very happy to say that I was not disappointed - in fact, Inspire exceeded my expectations tenfold. 

I had a difficult time with their menu because so many of the items looked AMAZING. I don't know if I've ever had such a tough time choosing an entree at a restaurant. I ended up deciding on the Chicken and waffles, since I have yet to try this popular dish at any restaurant up to now, and it was exceptional. The fresh fruit, mango edamame, and ginger syrup was an amazing combination with the fried chicken - an awesome balance of sweet and savory. The breading on the chicken though also had a bit of a sweetness too, and was very good. 

The staff were very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is very cool - would go back again and again, and would recommend to anyone.

One tip, that I will also share below - make a reservation! This place is hopping, monday through sunday, and twice before coming today I tried to walk in and found them completely full and booked up. Take the time to reserve your table - it's well worth it!",5,DQCs39wFHFC3LLNMAa39hg
"I had the large Cali bowl which came to just a bit over $15 with tax. Importantly for that price there was a very reasonable amount of tuna and salmon...I hate it when other places skimp on the star protein of the bowl. 

The combo of flavors was delicious and very filling. The fake crab slaw was yummy and the fried onions added a delicious crunch. Avocado always a winner with salmon and tuna. I substituted brown rice and had the wasabi mayo both were great. Little disappointed they didn't have the macadamia nuts on the menu which I was willing to pay extra for. 

Guy who made my bowl just stared at me no hi or what would you like. Girl he handed it over to was pretty grim too - didn't ask if I wanted any garnishes and just said very matter-of-fact ""no macadamia nuts"". Cashier was much better. Saying that I'm here just for takeout at lunch so don't really expect 5 star service. I'd come back and try some of the other bowls as long as they don't start cheapening out on the fish portions.",4,nDgT-mjSa7zI7gI9aXeikw
"Find Strip Liquor across from the Stardust Hotel. It's an expensive but convenient place (easy parking, easy access, large selection) to get any beer, wine, or liquor you might want/need. We stocked up here before a social engagement... good times.",4,ceQFsrd5LdABz7iZRqLFaw
"Food is mediocre. Service was almost nonexistent on the patio. You can tell they cater to the older population around here that has nothing but time on their hands. Went 15 minutes with an empty glass. Server walked by twice and no refill. Had to ask for a drink refill for which there is no excuse.

Star added for quick response and desire to improve from business. I'll be giving them another shot.",2,D3jqGT2GY0ioIJcClVSpNQ
"Great customer service, great museum, lots of stuff to learn. You need at least 2-3 hours to roam through the museum and dress comfortably it can get hot inside.

"I can't believe I've never rated the Horseshoe ! 

Hot.tips for surviving here. 

Don't order food
Some taps are okay , some aren't
Order bottled beer
Don't expect the bathrooms to be the picture of cleanliness. 
Be nice to the staff because they have dealt with a lot of drunks and are very long suffering. 
Do expect a decent rock show in the back, preferably from someone local.",4,sGE0dH0bCWOe-LQ8Zq-SVg

"This is for the Dog Park.  
We have not brought our dogs here in a while as grass was barren and dog turds were abound.  Not this time.  Looks like it has been recently seeded and allowed to get established so I'm guessing it was closed for a while.  

So this park has plenty of running room for the dogs, a nice aggregate walking path for owners, water source for dogs and generally many other dogs to chum up with yours.  There are several permanent benches for seating and a covered shade structure.  Plenty of trash cans to pick up after your dog with poo bags available or scooping tools.  I just wish more people picked up after their dog or assume they did and pick up a pile you see to make up for missing your own dogs.  As the poo situation was way better than past visits, I still walked continuously for 10 minutes scooping pile after pile.  

Bathroom facilities are located within a couple hundred feet from dog park in between the sports fields.  Parking is convenient and if you have kids playing a sport at sports fields, bring your pooch along and let them enjoy the dog park.  The entire facility is nice and usually great fellow dog lovers and owners.",3,sYYeYhi8rgouTLafXbyDQA
"I have been going here for years. Most days 3 stars, every now and then 5 stars, and now myself and my husband will never come back to this restaurant. The service was terrible.  The server seemed to be overwhelmed with his 4 tables. The table next to ours was complaining as well with more complaints than I can imagine. I've been in the service industry and still am for 22 years. Never  have recieved my salad after my meal and have never had cold crab legs. Saw on my bill the crab legs  were taken off as I requested  (with no apology or replacement by my server) just an ""uh...ok..and off he went. Never seen a server so frazzled with 4 tables, maybe a bad day? Don't know. His attitude was the same with each table he dealt with that I observed. On my bill the reason given for  the crab legs taken off were ""customer didn't like"" Are you freaking kidding me??? My favorite food of all time, just don't like them cold! Weird? And I still tipped that jerk $20 & it Would've been  $40 to $50 per my norm if the service was good, but it was horrible. Something I also noticed,  no manager responds to any of these yelp reviews, so in short, Black Angus doesn't really  give a shit about our experience or opinion.  Btw, manager took out drink order, brought our drinks, then we saw our server. Never saw manager again unail she told my husband to have a good night when we were leaving! Hahaha!",1,uvsEOmXy5NxmYV91HIQQ9A
"the vegwich (aka portobello burger) left a lot to be desired. it was a however, the tu-nuts (spicy tuna in a cucumber boat) was literally one of the best things i've ever put in my mouth. i would come back based on that dish alone. the truffle fries were good, also loved the juices.",4,wdNx0NH16pXVBGJ-jLb2Nw
"I visited Wheelfish after thanksgiving and I cannot wait to go back. I am not from the area, but was visiting friends and I am glad we chose to go there for dinner and drinks. Loved the aesthetic of the bar, so nicely decorated. The live music was an added touch to the dining experience; loud enough that you could enjoy it, but quiet enough so that you could easily enjoy conversation with friends. 
They have a good food selection which is different than your normal bar food. Good smoked meats and a nice selection of side dishes. I had the sweat potato fries (the dipping sauce was amazing!), the bbq pulled pork sandwich and the slaw; all were great! 
The girls working were friendly and accommodating.  
There is a wide variety of drink selections available for someone who enjoys craft beer. I was with a friend who loves bourbon and he was in heaven. My favorite drink was their take on a Mexican mule; made with vodka but with an added jalapeño. It was the best mule I've ever had and I haven't been able to find one as good. 
I'm going to be back to the area soon and cannot wait to visit again!",5,7-CeEdbs7WwGSt5Z6LNMoA
"Sushi Three is my favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh. Their food is always excellent. I've only eaten in the restaurant a couple times, I usually order take out. The vegetable spring rolls are delicious. They are crispy, not greasy & the dipping sauce they come with is so good! It tastes like a wasabi mustard combination. Cold sesame noodles are good. My favorite makisushi is the spicy salmon tempura roll, they fry the outer shell of the sushi so it's crispy & it's lightly topped with sauce. The Shadyside Roll which is smoked salmon, cream cheese & avocado, any of the vegetable tempura rolls which is a choice of yam, broccoli, asparagus or zucchini & the fresh salmon roll are all great choices. 
You can't go wrong with Sushi Three. If you're a fan of sushi they are a must try!",5,0xXR7OqVT6ghyDmyBh3EJA
Absolutely horrible. Can't get the job done on time. It takes them a week and a half to do 1 poster that other companies can do in 1 day yet they promise the same ETA.

"After hearing good things about this restaurant, I tried it.  I was disappointed.  The portions of entrees are good, but the food is mediocre.  Our chicken egg rolls were small, dry, and not very tasty.  My family style bean curd was presented mild as I requested it, but it was close to tasteless, in a bland, weak, watery sauce.  My favorite Chinese restaurant, Red Tea House in Mount Lebanon, is able to prepare a mild General Tso's tofu dish which is full of flavor and served in a rich sauce.  My lady's chicken with mixed vegetables was better, but not the best.  I would have been better off at nearby Sesame Inn for a few dollars more.  I do not plan to return.",2,wh2pLUZjp38xLc4Tkixk3Q
"I absolutely love this place. The food,  drinks and the location are equally amazing. My favorite is their peach long Island ice tea and the chicken avocado egg rolls.

"Wanted to eat at the Robuchon outpost in Las Vegas for quite a while...  I was not disappointed.  The bar occupys up to about 40 guests with well informed servers presenting your food to the guest over the counter.  It becomes obvious that you are at a Robuchon's vision of being a japanese  style counter chef.  But with Robuchon's stern eye in the room,  his food is complete in all forms but none.

The crispy thin tart of sweet onion and pancetta was offered with a couple of perfectly cooked quail eggs that burst with the mellow yellow yolk.  It was so delicious and it was garnished with a nice pairing of sorrel greens.  He had the fancy stuff too.  Such as the quail egg stuffed with foie gras and served with truffle potatoe puree.  Man it was good.  Very small and expensive... but it was worth it.  I think.
One dish stood out above the rest and that was the steak tar tar... Basically a raw burger patty with the fixings ... dijon. onions. pickles.  s&p... Served with french fries and a tiny little wedge of iceburg lettuce, I really began to think I was eating a burger and fries.  

The presentation is very precise and the line cooks take there time to get things right on the plates.  They move fast but take their time on the plates.  A sign of a good experience to come.  

But it just so happened that he was there that weekend and I got to meet the icon... practically a god to most people.  He is the inventor of new cusine almost.  But more then all of that, he is just a great chef.  I found he was a very nice man and up next  is hopefully the Mansion next door.  When I asked him how it was... he just smiled looked at me and nodded his head up and down with a silly little smile on his face and I trusted his every nod.",5,BpJeFJ1ai2aqwrRboLHpfw
"This hip japanese noodle / Ramen house is off the beaten path bear Mill Avenue and hard to find.  When you do find it, you will be happy.

You fill out a subway style menu choosing your broth, then add additional toppings such as soft egg, garlic, corn, etc.  

They have a decent Sake selection including unfiltered.  Service is actually really attentive. The ambiance is definitely casual and mellow.   If you sit in the center zone, they are often playing old Japanese marital arts  movies.",4,U3SoSiUg-pyS8IsSIoCnOg
"I love this place the shakes (ice cream) one large is enough for a whole family. I see a lot of bad reviews but i really enjoy it. now the service is really slow in the drive through but the food is really fresh and the shakes are amazing. so worth a few minutes. i really like the zucchini as a sub for fries.

I noticed a lot of people put bad reviews because so teenager is going through puberty and gives them bad service. come on people really? can't you get the same crap service from any fast food chain?",4,gBOpWtIjjsXGDPM1kQamMg
"Went here for dinner one night. Love love love this place. We got a bunch of different things.. Crab, shrimp, etc. We got it medium and it was still super spicy. Anytime I can find one of this chain, I try to visit it. Would recommend to everyone who loves steamed shellfish.",5,n0uk867XhZPGdApG89Vjnw
"Ironically, we enjoyed the appetizer and the dessert,but the entrees were nothing to write home about. 

The steamed mussels, an appetizer, was fresh and the sauce complemented their delicate flavor nicely. For entree, we got the Blacken Chilean Steelbass and the House Special Cedar Smoked Salmon.  Biting into the blackened steelbass was, well, fun, but the taste isnt' anything revolutionary and it was a bit dry.  The Salmon had potential for innovative dish, but it was overly sweet and vinegary, which gave it a generic cast.For dessert, we got the mini creme brulee, a highlight of the meal. It had a particularly rich creamy body with a thin layer of caramel. The whip cream that came with it was outstanding and not merely decorative. 

For a seafood place, the price was very reasonable.",3,1Fz8vGnBIr68aj1_eO19hA

"I'm so glad kushikatsu has finally arrived in Toronto! I ordered the set for $18.99 which included 8 different skewers, soup, rice and cabbage - a good option if you're visiting for the first time and not sure what to order. I enjoyed most of the items but the veggies were probably my favourites. I also loved their miso soup! Service was also pretty good, but prices are definitely a bit steep given you can get kushikatsu in Japan for half the price.",4,Tt7O3jugA1IW4cGMUkeKHQ
"Came here on a busy Saturday night for dinner.  We made reservations for our group of 4 but they didn't have our reservation noted.  After some back and forth with the wait staff (at one point the even asked us to leave the table we were already seated at), we finally settled into our seat.  It's a good thing they have a call button, because even with the call button we had a difficult time getting the attention of a server.  Sub-par service aside, the sushi really speaks for itself.  
We ordered a medium combination platter (83 pieces of sushi, maki & sashimi) - this platter was ~$90.  The quality of the fish here is really awesome - good substantial size, fresh and sweet.  There's also a really good variety of different fish in the platter.  It was a struggle to finish the whole boat.  The service left much to be desired, but with the high quality and great value of the food we will definitely be coming back here!",4,__x68FCfbsTPtXNMFU4OJQ

"Excellent place to go for top shelf beer,  but when it comes to the food,  ask about what you're ordering. The Cordon Bleu Schnitzel isn't anything remotely close to what the name suggests.

On my second trip, I order a Chicago Dog on a pretzel bun.  It wasb bc coming coming in into  good, but a little  e to chewy for me.  At closing I was given a bag  bc c we the doughnuts.

The salad I did end up with though was awesome. It had chicken on it which I'm usually skeptical of because its often processed and salty but this was quite good, not salty at all. A nice bed of mixed greens with tomatoes, cucumbers and feta cheese and all or only 9.00$ that kind of price is practically unheard of on the path.

"I really don't understand how this place is as bad is it is.  Vietnamese food isn't so exotic in this town to justify this place's horrible interpretation of the cuisine.

The menu seemed pretty weak.  We started with some spring rolls that were just awful -- bland and poorly wrapped.  The pho was greasy and fatty.  The stir fry concoction I ordered was just bland.  The service was pretty disinterested and our server didn't seem to know much of anything about the food he was serving.  All told, lunch for 3 people was nearly $40, which was about $40 more than it was worth.",1,9qbMeiRcHm8kjp51S68dWQ

"I feel like 5 stars isn't enough. We had such a wonderful time the other day during our round of golf at The Phoenician Golf Course. 
I will also mention that it topped out around 112 degrees that day as well, so keeping me happy all day wasn't an easy task.

The summer rate is awesome, via Golfnow.com we got a tee time at 11:36 a.m. for only $35 (including tax) per person. It also included a cart and as many range balls as we could handle. 

Once we arrived I quickly remembered we were at one of the nicest resorts in Arizona. People around to help with anything and everything. 
When we got there the guy outside got our cart ready to go while we checked in with the shop inside. When we came back the clubs were set, he had loaded the ice chest with water (complementary) and ice, made sure we had everything we needed and sent us on our way. Not before letting us know that we could take our time at the range, as there weren't many people out today so we could tee off pretty much whenever we wanted. 

We hit a few balls then to the first tee we went. I didn't play any of the holes, I was the birthday boys caddy for the day. So basically I sat in the cart, in the shade, looked pretty and pulled the pin every now and then. They had no issue with me just riding along, and I didn't have to pay. So awesome! 

The course is beautiful! Looks just as immaculate as I'm sure it does during the cooler months. The views were amazing too! We played too 9 hole courses, Oasis and Canyon. Both awesome. Oasis has a lot of water around it and really lush and green. Canyon was further up the mountain a bit, great too look out on the city. 

The drink/snack cart chica came around several times, loaded us up withmore ice and water. We were very thankful for that!

When we were finished, the golf dude washed his clubs and kept an eye on them while we went in to grab a cocktail at the bar. 

Thank you Phoenician! We will be back! maybe not when it's $250 a round, but we will be back.",5,ZAPnTnF4b6ultVqlZptDzQ

"(Note that I'm rating 2 stars which I think is applicable for vegetarians or ppl who don't eat seafood and are going for the dinner buffet). 

This is my second time at Caesars and the first time for dinner. The first thing we noticed was that my girlfriend who is vegetarian didn't have many options at all - we've come to assume that Vegas buffers are good for vegetarians but this definitely was not the case. And even though I eat meat, I don't really eat seafood so a lot of the options were ruled out for me too. It seemed to us that most ppls meals revolves around seafood and that seemed to be the highlight of the buffet. 

Apart from the lack of food options, we were extremely disappointed with the service at the counters - there seemed to be no one around to help answer our questions, the dishes were mislabeled quite a few times, and the Choco lava cake that I got was mediocre at best. 

Nevertheless we had enough food to stuff ourselves with, and coupled with the bottomless mimosa package that we got, made up for some of the experience.",3,TP6EjNyq0GZ_gk8T-poBcQ

I have been to Montreal 3 times now and can only say that Julliette's & Chocolat is a must go to adventure. Multiple locations - we went to the one on St Laurent. Easy to spot in the corner- large sigh and patio. You can smell the sweetness from a block a way. Chocolatiers have not only mastered the sweet they have also done well with savory. This was the first stop of Montreal for my friend ( her first time in Montreal) and they didn't disappoint. We ordered brunch: I the spinach /buckwheat crepe with sunny side egg and my friend the Turkey. Be aware they do have gluten free options but their crepes are made with Buckwheat. We each tried some form of chocolate latte and then after some time of easy chatter and digestion we shared the Tiramisu. Best brunch experience ever! Can definitely purchased goods to go as they have great fondue sets. St Laurent location was large and I have been to St Denis location- small but quaint - still the same yummy smell and ambience of each!,5,h4v1h6y2Gb0rZJiX9RlQzg

Yeah right. When I was waiting for the manger who they said would not speak to me because I was not driver. They then threatened to call security on me because I was telling another person what happened to us. some lady at the front desk told me to shut up and they were not gonna help us.

"I am a huge theatre fan. I am always on the lookout for good shows and the Gammage is the first place I look. There is never a bad seat in the house because of the way it is built. I have always sat in the balcony area because I am a teacher and we know how much they get paid, but I am always able to see what is going on and I still have a great time. 
    The last show I saw was Mamma Mia and it was amazing! The acoustics are fantastic, and being a band teacher, it sticks out. I am always pleasantly surprised that I can hear all of the actors clearly and be able to hear the orchestra accompany the songs.
    The reason I gave it four stars, is because of the bathroom fiasco. There are several bathrooms but whoever installed them,was definitely not a woman because there were only 2 stalls for 2 levels of seating for women. I have hit the bathrooms at the right time and the wrong time. The wrong time was standing in line for the entire intermission only to finish as the lights were cueing us to go back to our seats. Of course, you forget about the inconvenience when the show starts back up again.

They gave my wife a Surgeon referral after the CT scan, my wife told the front desk folks not to send the CT info to that Surgeon until we could check to see if he was in OUR Network.

We went out our Network Oral Surgeon on Nov. 7th and he did not have the CT info, so more scans had to be done & paid for.
I called Dr. Krygiers Office on the afternoon of the 7th and was told by his office staff they sent the CT info to the wrong Surgeon (their referral).
We paid Dr. Krygier $339.00 and got NOTHING....we want a refund and a apology.
His office gave out information to the wrong Surgeon!!   Extremely poor Service.",1,WgKAlVk92B9oa6eLHcXgJw
"Went here solely for the oyster bar.  Had to wait around 20 min before a spot opened up at the bar.  The oysters were super fresh, delicious, and satisfying.  Best oysters I had so far.

"American Fine Art Editions, located in the internationally known Arts District in Scottsdale carries an impressive number of works by Keith Haring, Andy Warhol, Peter Max and other artists in a 12,000 square foot gallery at the intersection of Main Street and Scottsdale Road.  

The sales personnel can be overly aggressive in securing a purchase and have been known to be less than truthful when trying to close on a sale, so beware of any promises that are made.  While they are a reputable gallery, do require that any agreements be made in writing.",4,7RBCzHKV9bVZKO9zHIe7cA

"I went here with my family to check out this new ice cream place. The staff and owners were very friendly and courteous. The service was excellent and the treats were even better! We even got to sample the mini donuts. 

If you are a Dole Whip fan, or a Peet's coffee fan, this is the place on the northwest side of town to get it! Everything looked amazing and their prices are incredible! I am hoping they add some more sugar free treats to their menu in the future. We will definitely be back! We can't wait to try out breakfast when the full menu is ready in a few days. It's hard to find a good treat shop with genuinely friendly service. Try them out, you won't be disappointed!",5,SKC2MxeYo5-NfcODzoI9Xg

"If you know anything about Go-Karting, do NOT go there. For one, the staff was very rude, don't acknowledge you upon arrival, not even the manager. The rules were not enforced at all. They put you in a room where they just say watch this video where people just walked out to the track just to ignore it. Nobody makes sure you watch the video, just leave you in a room that you can easily walk out. On the track, there was just one guy, not caring at all that was happening on the track not knowing what he was supposed to do. Flags weren't used when trying to pass, he walked off at times mid-race more focused on a girl.  He used the YELLOW flag which means CAUTION to end the race instead of the CHECKERED. My sister spun out and I passed her 4 laps before he came back and realized she was out of the race. Did I mention the Go-Karts were horrible? This is my 5th go-kart place and by far the worst I've been to. If you have kart experience, DO NOT come here!",1,xiQ73zGxKIN8vQg6CrrMeQ
"I have been meaning to write this review for awhile. I absolutely love this place. I usually get the steak skewer but sometimes I will get the chicken and I am ALWAYS happy with either choice. The steak is very high quality and it is like biting into a piece of filet mignon. I love the lady at the counter. She recognizes my daughter and I and it really feels like I've come home and my mother wants to feed me. The baklava is out of this world, try the hummus and pita, you can find none better and please try the garlic sauce. Delicous!",5,VDCbgdVJNHXRO4ca2HSaBA
"My husband and I went here for our anniversary and had a great experience. It was a little pricey but the food and service were worth it. I think this is by far the best ""special occasion"" restaurant in the Phoenix area. Not as snobby as some of the places in Scottsdale resorts and far better food than Compass downtown. 

We started off at the bar since our table wasn't ready when we arrived. They have a variety of specialty martinis. The ""Great Fruit"" was a good sweet and fruity cocktail and the candied grapefruit slice made it special. I ordered the ""SKOCU THU"" which had a bit of spice to it and was garnished with a dried chili. It sounds weird but it was amazingly good! Definitely one of the best cocktails I have ever had. The bartender also made a smaller sized Mesquite Bean Martini for us to sample which had excellent flavor but I think you have to like Bourbon to truly enjoy it. 

As for the food, the menu is a little different and requires an adventurous palate. I enjoyed the Native American influence and focus on local food. We ordered an appetizer that had cured ham, raw fish, and buffalo tartare, which worked well since it had a variety of items to try and was a good for sharing. There was a small soup included in the meal (just a taster size) and also sorbet to cleanse the palate between courses. My husband ordered the Buffalo as his entree which was a good size and he said it had excellent flavor. I had the Seafood Potpourri which was also excellent though I am not sure how that fits in with their Southwest theme. The only criticism of the menu that I have is that the only poultry item was duck. So, if you are not a game meat or seafood person you would be out of luck. I did appreciate the fact that they had a good selection of half-bottles and wine by the glass because after the martinis we could not have handled a full bottle of wine. Since it was our anniversary they gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse for dessert and so that was a nice surprise but I think otherwise they still provide truffles as a finish.

I highly recommend Kai as a place you must try at least once, but be prepared to spend some money.",5,ZTeOUUruDIpUIVp8PluEbg
"This place is my favorite spot for Korean BBQ. Recently I went to a competitor in Henderson and it was such a disappointment. I almost felt like I cheated on Hwaro. 

The quality of the meats are great, flavorful, and they give you plenty. You are able to order half orders as well. The sides are a great selection and we love the bean sprouts! 

The price is a great and reasonable price. I highly recommend this place. You can also call to be added to the seating list!",5,cdqrTH1iUKGaXn6iGaD3Fg

"Need to rent a car occasionally.  Have been going to the airport in LV until I found this place on Warm Springs Rd.  Needed a Cadillac for a special occasion.  Went there and spoke to the manager Samantha B.
Told her it was real important that I get a Cadillac.  She told me she would personally take care of it.  
Came back one month later and SHE DID!!  Car was fully detailed and waiting for me!  Truly amazing customer service!!!
Will only be doing business with Enterprise and Samantha going forward!!
Top Shelf!!  Thank you Samantha!! Fabulous Service!!

"Don't even get me started because I will just rave and rave. A group of six and we all ordered different entrees and tried one anothers. The lamb, the duck, the lobster stew and the chicken were so dang amazing. But listen to me when I say get the chicken. It had melted Brie cheese and my goodness it was THE best thing I have ever tasted. The presentation was beautiful and the price was so worth it! Service wasn't bad but that was because they were super packed on a saturday night. Creme Brûlée was the best I have ever had! Thank you Bonaparte and we will definitely be coming back with every trip to Montreal!",5,CCXEk4xVL_7xYsY31h0F0w
"I got the idea to go here from a review by a Yelp friend.  Jamms and The Egg and I are my goto Breakfast places.  I wanted to try a new place and this was it.  I got the Oatmeal with toasted pecans and blueberries.  Not much to say here but I've never had toasted pecans or blueberries in my oatmeal and this was very good.

I got a half Monte Cristo served with raspberry and maple syrup.  Geez!!!  My tastebuds went crazy happy.  Sooo... good.

The service was top shelf, refills were plenty without having to ask.  Very attentive staff and friendly.

The atmosphere was a 3 and looked like it could've doubled as a kick boxing center after closing hours, minus the mirrors.",4,YU8udzCYbUgfprh_reiDVw
"I just came from here and I wish  read the negative reveiews.   Service is a joke.  The lady who sat me down asked what color I wanted. I wanted ""white"" (but more of a shell color I pointed to)  Then a man comes up and asks me what color I want. Of course I said ""white"" and he begins to paint my nails. The lady who originally asked me what color is sitting next to him helping another customer. (Why ask me if you'll be with another customer??) After he's finished with painting my nails she realizes that he is painting my nails white-out white and starts yelling at him. I told her it was okay, because honestly I didn't care. I would've stopped him if I did.  Either way, It was kind of a cold atmosphere the best thing about my experience was that Sharknado was on their tv.  (Yea - that was the best thing!) 

Besides getting gel polish, I could've had a friend do it for about $20 cheaper.  Not going here again. I'm going back to Nicole at Riposa Salon.",1,EkArGkQ0Obx28yx1knT4mg

"YES YES YES!! You need to see this girl right now. Kursten is THE BEST. She is a true professional who can do anything. And she does it PERFECTLY. 

After my bridal trial session all of my family and friends were AMAZED. She made me look like a SUPERMODEL. HOT DAMN!

If you are planning a WEDDING I'm telling you Kursten is your girl. She is cool, calm and KNOWS HOW TO WORK on the big day. She really *gets it. I giver her all credit for setting the mood, working quickly and reassuringly and even pitching in for BEAUTY ODDS and ENDS that you inevitably didn't plan for at your wedding. She's basically the hair and makeup and the WHOLE SHABANG. Even earlier, before the big day she was great to work with on phone and text to go over DREAM pics and answer questions. I can't believe how easy it all was. 

No FUSS just BLISS. I received so many comments at my wedding that are ALL BECAUSE OF KURSTEN. 

So NATURAL. So STRIKING. So GLAMOROUS. Those LASHES and LIPS and oh those CURLS! My hair was the BOMB and didn't feel heavy or greasy from too much product. Work it GIRL!

"In my opinion, put Red Lobster out of your head, and head here!  This place is phenomenal in all their seafood selections.  My husband and I chose to bring his parents here tonight, they are from PA, frequent Rehobeth Beach, DE, and they raved how some of what they ate parelled what they get ""at the shore""!  

For aps, my husband had the clams casino, my father-in-law had the wings, I had the ceviche, all excellent!  For dinner mother-in-law had the fish n' chips, father-in-law and husband had the harvest platter, I had the enchiladas with crab...amazing!  My MIL wanted the fish tacos, but she chose last minute the fish n' chips, and she loved it.  The boys loved the platter, although the crab cakes were less than desireable, and my enchiladas were the best seafood enchiladas I've ever had.  I have compared them to Maria Maria's crab enchilada suizas, these stand out beyond them.  

This place is like a sleeping secret, and I wanted to share this place should not be overlooked.  Its in the far southwest corner at Dana Park, is hidden, and is worthy of your seafood cravings!  

No more Red Lobster, people, give this place a go, and it is all sorts of family good, big tables, excellent food, good drinks.  Give to the locals, not to the chains.  They also have seafood for purchase, and its fresh as AZ can get it, and the prices are good.  I love the Salt Cellar, but they have since raised their rates through the roof, we looked for less pricey, and they serve up just as amazing food.  Its quaint as well, reminding you that you are in a local seafood joint, and takes you as if you were just off the beach, whether west coast or east coast.  We have the east coasters to prove it!",5,YvBFP0OLU_xASWed8w9ZqA
"Grouchy John's was a excellent experience. I went there over 10 times in my 3 week vacation.

"I had been itching to try this place out for so long because I worked with a fellow who was from Miami and raved about Cuban food (which was back in December). And word of mouth is Havana Grill is the place to get your Cuban food fix. Although I was a skeptical to try this place because of Teri C.'s review and the other reviews as well, I had to try them out for myself. 

Fortunately we came in during happy hour, which was half prized appetizers. We ordered the Mezcla de Aperitivos (consisted of tamal, papa rellenas, croquetas, and cuban sandwich) and Mini Sandwich Cubano. 

Tamal- I didn't like their tamal at all. More dry than usual and no taste either. 

croquetas- we weren't sure what these were because there wasn't a description on the bar menu. Unfortunately, as soon as I took a bite I spat it back out into my napkin. Maybe this was a little too authentic for me. 

Mini Cuban Sandwich- the bread was nicely buttered and the contrast between the mustard and pickles was a unique mix. The ham could had been a little tastier, but good enough. I was really expecting more based on how much people rave about Cuban sandwiches. I'm really hoping other Cuban places make a better one because theirs was just A-okay. 

There was no papa rellenas at the time was I was kind of sad because they serve those at Porto's Bakery. I also ordered the guava shake, although I'm not a big guava fan I was trying to be adventurous. I didn't really enjoy this drink because there was nothing special about it and I prefer my shakes on the thick side and itwas rather thin. 

Overall, the experience was okay. The service was a tad slow and the food didn't really impress me. The inside is nicely decorated and still gives off the mom and pop vibe. However, I don't think I will be coming here again.",3,SxnSmbsF1DV3exGGRRJfqQ
"Finally a nice Thai food place in beautiful Boulder City, NV. Lettuce wraps were crisp and full of flavor. Ginger Chicken, Beef with Broccoli, and their super hot Curry Chicken were spot on. The Dining experience was a pleasure. The service was expeditious. I did not particularly like the peanut sauce as their house salad dressing but that was just me, otherwise this a pleasant surprise in a small town not known for this kind of food.",4,RkzkDea_ll9H-CCHyB_q9A
"Since Mother's Day is a special occasion and District was having a special event, we decided that now was as good a time as ever to try this place.  I am so glad that we did.  While I balked at how much we spent, I can't help but remember how good everything was, and that it is definitely worth it.

We brought my other mom, mother-in-law, because she has a special appreciation for all things downtown and she had been wanting to try this place as well.  This place really is beautiful.  There is a modern edge to everything, but it's styled in a way that makes you feel incredibly comfortable here.  The staff is all unbelievably nice and friendly.  We were greeted with ""Happy Mother's Day"" all the way outside by the valet attendants to the inside by our server.  Not one staff member walked by without saying it.  That's a nice touch.

Now the food.  WOW!  The buffet line was beautifully set up and was filled to the brim with excellent food.  I sampled, and then some, so much food that I thought I would burst.  I'm going to present this in list form because it's just easier that way.
-French Toast Casserole: Sweet and tasty.  Like bread pudding in pecan roll form.
-Scrambled Eggs - Light and fluffy and well seasoned.
-Yogurt Parfait - Served in a martini glass with seriously good granola.
-Bacon - Very good and cooked well.
-Sausage - From Schreiners, very good but a tad to spicy for breakfast (at least for me)
-Biscuits & Gravy - Different.  It wasn't very sausagey but I really enjoyed the taste of it.  It was not as heavy as normal B&G.
-Fresh Fruit - The berries were served in shot glasses and were so perfect I couldn't believe it.  
-Mac&Cheese - Definitely not my style, it was really boring to me, I would actually be upset if I ordered it.
-Chocolate Mousse Cake - INCREDIBLE.  I wish I wasn't so stuffed at this point of my meal to actually enjoy it more.  The cake was super moist and dense, but the mousse inside was amazing.  I could eat a whole bowl of that stuff.

I couldn't have been more pleased with this place.  Everything was delicious and beautiful.  I felt strangely at ease here.  It seems to be a fancy place, but it wasn't pretentious like I had expected.  We had such a wonderful time, and our server Jeff was fantastic.  One thing I was so amused with was every time an employee saw a napkin unfolded, they would twist it around and make it look nice again.

Bottom line, I would love to come here again, but I will have to wait till Payday.",5,rWtHCTzV2OSPOvUrLQ6F8w

"the wait staff is great.  very friendly and happy for the most part.  the older lady who took my order was not the friendliest.  I got the 2 eggs and biscuit with gravy that comes with hash browns and toast. I asked for a side of bacon and a coffee.  the meal is priced on the menu for $6.95.  there is no bacon side listed anywhere I could see.  the coffee is $1.90
so my total was 13.74.  so looks like I was charged 3.75 for 2 pieces of bacon that were cooked yesterday.  yep not fresh at all.  
the biscuits were made with lard or oil that is old.  you can taste it.  you know that rancid oil/lard smell/taste.  yep.  not good.  could have been much better.  for what they are charging they need fresh foods and biscuits that taste like fresh with a buttery taste not a rancid oil taste.  
not impressed and I wont be back.
and by the way I am also a restaurant owner and I know fresh when I taste it.  we only use fresh items in our establishment.

"I have been enjoying Dudt's donuts at work for over two years now! I have two coworkers who bring them frequently for birthdays and other special occasions. You can definitely taste the difference between a Dudt's donut and the chain competition. I tried to eat a Dunkin donut recently at a work event and literally couldn't finish it.

Because of my positive experience with the product, I was expecting an equally positive experience when I stopped by the shop last week for my husband's birthday. I wanted to pick up a half dozen of cookies to take home to him for his special day. 

Though the cookies that I purchased were very tasty, my experience was just...awkward. There were four women working, but none of them acknowledged my presence when I entered the (very small) shop. One of the ladies was blocking most of the counter (standing on the customer side) and it took her some time to realize that I couldn't see what to order due to her standing in the way. As I was leaving, she proceeded to block me from exiting as she picked up some sort of... bug, I think? from the ground inside the shop and placed it not far from the entrance outside.

My whole in-store experience was just strange and I look forward to returning to eating the treats that my coworkers provide, not picking them up myself.",3,mSx-rmlEfr2gtkllYGr-ow

The only thing I am removing a star for is that they did have an obscenely violent and gross kung fu movie playing on all of their TVs, and their cocktails are not all that sophisticated. However, for the price- it is well worth a visit.",4,wnxandVk4iJI_S9E2l2mKw

"I have been going to Dr. Sciulli's office for ten years now. Prior to his care, I had not seen a dentist in many years due to my fear of dentists. He has done a great job of easing my worries and saving my teeth. His cleanings are great, no hygienist rather the actual dentist. When I've needed fillings there are no issues, he always makes certain they don't rub or feel awkward. I read people questioning his tactics with the cavity detector but honestly wouldn't you rather have every piece of technology examine your teeth, early warning detection is a blessing. And as far as insurance is concerned, after being with Dr. Sciulli for so long, the office is amazing at working to get your insurance to cover the procedures (and I should know, after all these years I have had three different dental insurances). Dr. Sciulli's dental practice is truly a little gem in south Oakland and I recommend anyone looking for a GREAT dentist to seek him out you will not be disappointed.",5,yUKLBbIOZO_Bsvlp7f_xpA

"Not the fanciest restaurant but food is fairly good with plenty of seating for larger groups. I ordered a deluxe teppanyaki which comes with a salad, miso soup, meats of your choice, steamed rice, and 1 scoop ice cream. All of this for about $23 without tax. Flavours were good but I did find it greasy. If you are super picky about food contamination/cleanliness, I would avoid this place as the chef uses the same spatula for raw meat as he does for everything else including fried rice and veggies. That being said, it was a great show: he entertained us by setting the grill on fire and doing tricks with the cooking utensils! If I return, I will try their sushi and sashimi next time as they had a lot of variety on the Japanese menu. Plenty of parking around this restaurant located at corner of Tomken and Eglinton. 

Gave 3 stars because overall it was a lot of food (and decently delicious too) for the price, with fine service. Gave it 2 stars less because it wasn't the most sanitary or nicely decorated restaurant.",3,oFFnqjgTnGJutklzZhUKbQ

"pros- 
-24 hour deal for the buffets such as Carnival, PH, Paris, etc. 

cons-
-parking is far 
-old people casino
-bad customer service
-worse room I have ever stayed in

Experienced the worst customer service here. When we got to the room, we were disappointed to see how ""big"" the room was...which it was not that big at all being a suite & all.. It seemed like a regular hotel room. 
The air conditioner sucked ass.. we had blasted at 60 and we were still fanning ourselves and that was after we had complained and they had someone ""fix it"" by replacing the filter.. I guess you cant expect too much since the RIO is one of the oldest hotels in vegas...
The towel hangers came off... yea..surprise surprise..

the bed sheets had nasty brown spots..

the refrigerator felt like a cooler would have been a better and cooler option. 

Lastly the pull out bed looked like it has been ""pulled"" all over the place.. the mattress was completely falling apart... it was sad for my friend who had to put up with it for one night and he even hurt himself trying to pull that disgusting old thing out of the couch. 


When I complained the next day all they could do was ""send someone out for repairs""... I really was not trying to upgrade to a bigger room just a room that is not terrible... even if it is the same kind just a different room. ..and I asked the lady how long it would take because obviously this is an inconvenience for us.. she stared at me with a nasty look and replied, ""well you can stay int he room!""..-- wow what an awesome customer service you just gave me you incompetent worthless customer service representative... I mean really I just want to be comfortable and do you really expect that we can sleep and feel like we have some privacy with 3 men walking around the room and fixing things and moving the couch out and putting in a new one? really? really? okay yeah sure I would love to stay in the room and awkwardly try to ignore the three men trying to ""fix things"". 


the casino sucked as well.. its all OLD people. like old people that smell.

they offer a shuttle every 30 mins but its too bad its only good until 1 am so if you are out partying late then you either walk you ass home or pay for a cab(about $15).


overall our experience here was terrible. 

I recommend that you DO NOT plan on getting a room here.
Get the 24 hour buffet deal if you dont want to spend a lot on food.. buy it around 7 pm and you will be covered until 7 pm the next day.. so that covers your dinner, breakfast, lunch, and dinner again. Just don't stuff you face just because its a ""buffet"". We took advantage and ate at the Rio, Planet Hollywood, and almost at the Paris for crepes but we made it too late.

I also recommend bringing your own blankets.. the brown one that they give you is gross and feels like its made out of foam.. its not comfortable or soft. 


don't bother looking into this hotel.",1,fRdBoNpSbY4mP_t8ZWnn4Q
"Truly Bad Experience.
I took my kids for their examination to Summerlin Vision Center because it is listed on my Insurance. The wait was long and there was other people waiting 45min just to pick up their glasses. And the worst was they had signed in and the staff was just sitting around not doing anything. They didn't even know they were there waiting. We went for a contacts exam and the Dr. kept talking about Sunglasses. Stating that we could go look at some when the exam was over. When the exam was over and we went to front desk to pay the Dr. had added on a years supply of contacts without even asking me. I noticed the total for the exam was a lot more that it should have been. I asked for a copy of the prescription and It was very obvious they didn't want to give me a copy. We did buy a pair of glasses there  for my son. When his glasses were ready and we went to pick them up  the technician refused to check to see if the glasses properly fit him.

We found this place in yelp and went on a Friday night. The drink menu is my fav. We ordered duck wings which was juicy and tasty. The atmosphere is also one of the significant feature with a live music on Friday nights. Definitely will go back again!,5,7UboqyPAvXQrkNhGTKhWiA
"Went here for brunch with my girlfriend and a group of her friends. The decor was pretty cool with a rustic chic feel though at the expense of comfort as I was stuck between two different levelled wood tables. 

The staff were extremely limited with one poor girl supplemented by a few busboys serving the entire restaurant of over 40 guests, so predictably the service was extremely slow and incorrect. I waited 30 minutes for my spiked coffee and only when prompted did the waitress acknowledge that she had forgotten and would get on it, she had to be additionally prompted that I needed to choose what to spike it with! Her knowledge of the menu was extremely lacking, and her ability to take English orders was also limited as she seemed to understand slightly better when I switched to French.

The food was nothing to write home about and with the substandard service and wait time this place falls short of the mark. If you're looking for a brunch place in the area I would rather go to Toi, moi et café.",2,kJypY9v8EF1a8HAfqH5rzQ

"This is hands down my favorite coffee shop in the Scottsdale area. After having had enough of Starbucks' bitter tasting, overpriced coffee, I wanted a new local spot that could make a mean iced latte I so frequently crave. This place is it! Not only do they have amazing tasting coffee drinks and foobut their prices are great as well! It has a cute home-y vibe inside, and a great dog-friendly patio out back near the lake. The location is fantastic - right in McCormick Ranch and situated right on Lake Marguerite with a fantastic view of Camelback. I love getting my coffee to go and taking it for a walk around the lake. Oh, and do yourself a favor: order an Iced Caramel Macchiato (or Iced Caramel Latte, as they refer to it). You won't be disappointed!",5,1Ml5LjySH3TfVJKxQ08nbg

"Average food, terrible service. Their prime Yorkville location keeps them busy and servers make zero effort to be pleasant, never ever smiling or asking if you need anything. If you do need something, you have to work hard to catch their attention or get up and go after them to ask for what you need. Last time my shrimp tempura roll was cold and when I complained I was told that some people prefer it that way in the summer since its too hot outside. Really? I don't think so! Fresh, hot and crispy is expected from any kind of tempura. I went again today (short memory unfortunately) and my friend and I had the same way below average experience, with no smiles or attention from anyone. This was my last time in this place.",1,jrEDs_65EalcxJzU4-Yi7Q
"I so wanted to like this place. We came here on a Friday night, and were the only 4 people in the place. The waitress was very sweet and attentive. The service was exceptionally slow. 15 min. passed between when the first person got her vegetarian plate, and the last person got his chicken shwarma. I ordered the gyros sandwich, which came with salad and humus. I did not expect them to put both the salad and humus ON the sandwich. Be forewarned- the gyros is not fresh off a spit, but looks to be the pre-made kind they heat on the grill. Just confirms for us that Stephano's is the place to go. Sorry, Duzan.",2,gyo915JhZVue-m8MkRy9ng
"Two words for this place: Holy. Guacamole.

I have I thing for trout, and if I see it on the menu, I order it. Smoked trout -- even better. I love bacon too, well who doesn't? And guess what? I love guacamole. So in comes this dish from Momocho that combines all three! So if you are into this sort of thing, I'd say it is a good marriage of spice, smoke, acidity, ""good"" fat and ""bad"" fat. This is hands down the best guacamole invention in Cleveland, if not, the world. Mind (and taste buds) blown.

Downsides: small space. crowded. 

Reservations are a must.",5,jwfGYx0Ns4nwE6rDwPOWzA

"Bean & Cheese Burrito is a winner here, as are the breakfast burritos in the morning.  Service is fairly fast and there's ample parking at this location.

A few gripes...  

1.  None of the salsas are ""hot"".  Not even the ""extra hot"" one.  They need to rename those, or actually make them at least a little bit hot.
2.  The chips & salsa ratio is seriously way off.  Few chips with a rather large salsa portion. 
3.  The miniature salsa portion with the burritos is a joke, especially since chips do not come with the burrito like they do at some alternative places like Rubios and such.  Even if someone wanted to dip their burrito into the miniature cup, it is too small, and the portion is too small to be of much use for gently adding it to one's burrito as it is eaten.
4.  Adding onto #3 above, why not just add chips to the burrito order so the salsa isn't so lonely, or take away the salsa and drop the prices by 20 cents or so?",3,7I5tTKmGWemyrQDTsa5sOQ
"This place is a true treasure of Cleveland's culinary cuisine.  I came here with my boyfriend as a late night dinner.  The waitress ushered him in and found him a seat next to me.

We ordered the beef pho and a chicken with Vietnamese noodle dish.  Both were perfectly seasoned and very flavorful.  The broth just seemed to be completely saturated with flavor.  I have noticed that some Vietnamese restaurants will put in too much salt in order to compensate the flavor of their soup.  That's not the case here, there's just enough seasoning to bring out the real essence of the broth.  Also, the beef was just rare enough to be soft and also add to the delicacy.

The waiters were also prompt with refilling water and packaging our food once we finished.  Even though Vietnamese cuisine isn't very complicated, it does take a bit of mastery to get done right.  This place is definitely on the top of our favorites.

-polite staff
-perfect pho
-would come again",5,FozURego3iURQviEkM9OMA
"They are the most shady rv rental in Las Vegas. I went in to location to get a quote for the""ONLY"" RV in the showroom. They quoted me fo a much smaller unit letting me think I was getting the one in the showroom. I didn't find out this until I looked at floor plan of unit I reserved. I contacted the location and spoke with Sandra. She said she would speak with manager "" Judy Gonzales"" and someone would contact me in the morning. No one contacted me in the morning. So I went back to the location and spoke with Judy Gonzales. Which I must say in my opinion, has the poorest management skills I ever seen. I explained the situation to her and she came at me like I did something wrong . She said there was nothing she could do. Didn't try to come up with any solution to THEIR MISTAKE. You'd think for someone who was about to spend over $5000.00 , they would try to retain my business. I guess that's why they only have 2 stars on yelp. Don't waste your time or money with this company.

"We had a 2 BR 2 BA villa that suited our family's need very well. The rooms were large and the bathrooms great. While some of the equipment we wanted for the kitchen were not in the room, one simple phone call allowed us to get a crock pot, baking sheet, large knife,  etc. Great location for a family to visit Scottsdale, Flagstaff, and other areas. We took two days and went to Flagstaff to see the Grand Canyon and that worked out well. I'd recommend this property for a family. It was a good deal for us but we used points on a time share so not sure what the cost would be otherwise.",4,XIe9btPnuZVW_kf_dbxDKQ
"Overall- extreme disappointment.

Yes the car was fine, but the business practices were shady.

We booked and pre-paid for our car on-line, like we've done dozens of times with all of the various rental companies. We declined the extra insurance like we always do because we know our own MV insurance will cover us.

The line at the registration desk was ridiculous -an hour long with no exaggeration. When we hit the desk, they pulled up our reservation and asked if we wanted the extra insurance, which was curious because we already paid and declined it. We said we didn't need it.

When we turned the car in, we saw hundreds of dollars in unauthorized charges for things like insurance and bogus gas charges (we returned the car with a full tank.

We disputed the charge with our credit card vendor and they were able to get a partial concession from Budget, but I can't describe how deplorable the whole experience was and how downright shady and sleazy Budget was.

Never again, Budget, you have been excommunicated from all future consideration.",1,1U4EjTbbVuIMR8bMjHboTw

"Not much good to say at all about this place. We live in the neighborhood and wanted to give this place a shot. I immediately regretted even walking in the door. Our food was totally flavorless and a horrible value. I ordered the ""Hammered Hog"" sandwich, which touted a 1/2 pound of our house smoked pulled pork covered with blue cheese cole slaw. My wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich which stated it had a 1/3 pound of pulled pork on it. I swear, their was more meat on hers and mine was a buck more. Not that I would have wanted more meat, it had no flavor except smoke which I'm guessing was liquid smoke. The collard greens side I ordered was so acidic and lacking the long cooking time that this dish needs. I think they might have tasted sour because they had gone bad? My in-laws split a two meat combo and I was embarrassed to take them there. A $70.00 tab for two sandwiches, a split entree plate, one mixed drink and three sodas? Oh, and we ordered a plate of happy hour nachos which were store bought round corn tortilla chips, congealed cheddar cheese, maybe a cup of diced tomatoes and black olives with lackluster sour cream and salsa on the side. Needless to say, we will never go back. I give this place 6 months tops. Whoever thinks this qualifies as good BBQ needs to go to read a recipe and attempt to cook BBQ for the first time ever. I'm almost positive it will come out better.",1,oRK4Cvz7GdvfrE-6erT--g
"I'm writing this review because I got supper disappointed of the service. First the place was packed and me and my husband had the intention to play video poker. One of the machines was broken so we couldn't sit together. There was people in the bar without using the machines so finally when a couple decided to leave they told me and my husband that they got a spot for both of us. Second the place next to me smelled like trash and vomit, like fresh vomit recently being mopped. While we were playing the lady bartender asked my husband if he was enjoying his vaporizer, because she was not. She claimed that it was ""burning"" her throat. And that we should stop using it. Like really? You can said straight up vaporizers are not allowed instead of being rude. I guess they are not like that with people with cigarettes, because that's why your throat hurts, because you are in a closed environment where people smokes. Very disappointed .",1,MoG4pF6iVlMFW9wF5KQ19g
"So, my fam moved from NYC to Arizona a few years ago, and I'm sad to admit that I may be a bit of a snob when it comes to deli sandwiches (at one time I worked minutes away from Katz deli). I can't eat a lot of meat, so when I choose to, I want it to be good. That's not too much to ask, is it? I'm also not a fan of dishing out $10 for a sandwich that has mass distributed deli meats and cheeses (yes, boar's head, I'm looking at you). After 4 years in AZ I've pretty much given up on finding a good deli spot.

So then... I come across a positive review from a friend and my curiosity rises... And I go with my kids and MIL to check it out.

On that first visit we ordered an N.Y.T. Cubano, a White BBQ pork, a kids Mac-n-cheese... Oh wait - then my 3 yr old decides he wants eggs... Really, kid? The staff, however, didn't seem phased... Everyone was super nice and accommodating. They modified his meal and gave him an egg salad sandwich. Everything was so good. The white BBQ pork is seriously the best meat sandwich I've ever had. But the Cubano was excellent also (not overpowering salty but superbly flavored). When the kids Mac first came out, I was surprised to see a very small bowl. But do not be misled by the small bowl, my fellow yelpers! When I dumped her Mac on a flat plate to cook it off, it filled up the whole plate and was way more Mac than I expected. Btw - it is delicious.

We came back a few days later with a larger crew (there were 10 of us this time), so we were able to sample a wider selection of their menu. Hubby & I got a White BBQ pork (because I've been craving it since that first visit) and a pastrami sandwich and split both half and half. We also brought our 23 months old this time and we felt like he wasn't going to eat a full meal's worth. So we got 2 Macs, and our 5 y.o., 3 y.o. & 23 mos old split it in 3. Again, no problem, the staff brought out 3 plates and there was still plenty of food. The other 2 options that were ordered that time were the Caprese sandwich & the meatball sub. I seriously don't like meatballs, so i haven't tried it personally but both people at our table who got it - loved it. It also happens to be greeter Sam's favorite sandwich. The caprese sandwich looked great and I might want to try it the next time I'm there.

And if that's not clear - all meats are made IN HOUSE!!!

Totally worth checking out.",4,XuUhqG2ZQxsmSnxtugOUlg

It is a  healthy option which is good, but there are definitely better and more consistent places to go to. 

The chocolate covered strawberries are a nice plus but I'd rather have a better portion for the price instead of a free strawberry. The bread they give you is not the best either.",3,i7ACRySEfgA0aNp4L4kL7Q

"Came here for lunch on a Sunday. They had lunch specials going on - I ordered the rack of lamb lunch special, which came with soup (choice of borscht or spicy soup) and side (choice of rice, salad or potatoes). It came out to a reasonable $11.95. 

There was bread and coleslaw to start. I enjoyed dipping the bread in my soup, and the coleslaw was good. I chose the spicy soup which was very tasty. (I tried my friend's borscht soup and I def preferred the spicy one). The potatoes were sliced thinly and had dill which was a nice touch. Lastly, the rack of lamb...amazing! Cooked perfectly. Tender and tasty. Highly recommend if you enjoy lamb.",4,wX1OdqCr7ZoUSdbew-9e6Q
"I went to this office for 4 years and every year questioned why I kept going back, but it seemed like more of an inconvenience to find a new doctor, but this year was the last straw. First of all, the reception staff is extremely nice and helpful, but the doctor is so rude and lacks people skills. 

Every year I refuse to order contacts through them because they're at a high markup (typically 80-100%) from what you pay online. They claim to offer price matching but then don't when they see how low the prices are. They always try to pick a fight about it instead of acknowledging that the prices are lower and it's now a competitive market place since contracts can be sold online. 

This past visit, during my annual exam, the doctor didn't do anything differently and charged my medical insurance because she prescribed me eye drops that I didn't even know I was getting prescribed until she asked where I wanted my prescription sent. I then got my EOB from my health insurance and called the office immediately and they said that I would not be getting a bill. Magically, a billed showed up yesterday and they basically told me that it was unfortunate that the doctor never told me she was doing a medical exam and that my medical insurance would be charged, but that I would still have to pay. I will never be going back to this office and can't wait to go to new eye doctor next year.",1,nsy5Dk1MTFMv7yH27e8v3Q

"Ive been to this place twice so far. The first time was with girlfriends back in 2013 and we had a great time. We got a bunch of different appetizers and quite a few entrees as well. I remember the food being good for the most part. The alligator was tender and juicy and the crawfish spinach artichoke dip was so so good. The Tomohawk steak was so amazing and came on a giant bone they let you take home for your dog if you want. The only complaint the first time was the Beignets I ordered for dessert. Im from New Orleans and Beignets are supposed to be fluffy and sweet and a bit crispy and covered with powdered sugar or honey. These were disgusting and hard and falling apart and tasted like gross old overused oil. They were barely dusted with powdered sugar and such a dissapointment. 

The second time I went was Oct 2014 with my boyfriend. I bought a groupon so I thought that would be worth it since their prices are a little bit on the higher side. We had a few of their specialty drinks which were good and had a great amount of alcohol. Then we ordered Gumbo and the Ahi tuna tartare (?) for appetizers. The gumbo was below average. It didnt have very good flavor and wasnt even very warm. The tuna was even worse. It was cut kind of sloppy and jsut drenched in whatever sauce they use on it. For entrees my boyfriend got Jambalaya and I got a catfish and shrimp dish. The Jambalaya was also under-seasoned with a small amount of shrimp which was added for an additional charge. The dish I had with the shrimp was actually tasty but just too small of portions for what I paid (I think about $22). 

Overall, I would probably return again but only if I had a Groupon and only for the crawfish dip or tomohawk steak.",4,7A1O1ztRC492UHS_ApZESA
"We were coming back from the east side today which never happens so we decided to treat ourselves to Sweetie Fry. I was so excited because the first few times I went I was in loooove with this place and was just dying to get back. 

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I mean, it isn't bad. It's actually pretty good, but today's experience was just not on par with the past. 

Biggest, almost inexplicable change - NO MORE WAFFLE FRIES!! I cannot understand this. They are just no longer on the menu. These were like angel tears in the form of fries and the reviewers raved about them so I just didn't get it. I asked the kid behind the counter why no more waffles and he said they kept having the waffle fry cutter machine break and it cost too much to fix it. 

Ok, I get it, being a business owner is about making tough choices, but sorry, you've taken away a major plus about your menu. Those waffle fries were SO DAMN GOOD! Total bummer. Also the kid today didn't offer us the little scoop on top of the ice cream as usual. 

The fries were still pretty good, but I was really unimpressed when compared to my previous experiences. What a disappointment. I can see myself going back but no more going out of my way. :(",2,cF5Eq3S9cvaQPPqBNKhzCg

Last night that memory was completely shattered. When ordering the nigiri I was appalled at how inconsistent the fish was cut and the fact that the rice was horrible. They know more practice the art of making a quality product, the evidence to that is a machine that lays out the rice for them so I can slap a piece of cheap nori on it and turned into a very substandard role.

I experienced a great example of this attentiveness a few weeks ago when I made a commitment to bring coffee into an 8am meeting but stupidly only left myself 15 minutes to stop and get it. I first went into Starbucks next door and was told it would take at least 15 minutes to get a carafe filled. I quickly ran next door to Einstein's to see if I would have better luck, and to my great relief, the on-duty manager saw that I was in a hurry and told me he'd ""get it done."" About 6-7 minutes later, after true hustling, he gave me the full carafe and all of the cups, creamers, etc. 

Anyway, it's possible management has changed since a lot of these reviews because my experiences have really been pretty positive. 

P.S. Try the asparagus egg breakfast sandwich on the thin wheat bagel. It's a great vegetarian option. Just ask for light sauce.",3,WAzpsDo-KeS_IXoQfhuUqg
"I have lived in my current home for 6 months. Some. security patrols my gated community - on bikes! They can't even drive after anyone who robs me to get a plate number. This company is a joke. Their security guards look super homeless walking around in their dirty security shirts. I didn't really care much until recently last week when they had a visitor to my home's car towed. It was parked in front of my house, not in a red zone. Did they knock on my door and inform us they would be towed? No! Whatever kickback the towing company gives Simon's broke security guards must have been worth it, and I'm sure unreported on a 1099.  I tried to call the Simon Security company and leave a message, but their mailbox is full (I'm sure full of complaints from customers they constantly fail). I also work out at EDC every year and we joke how their security leaves their posts and doesn't want to be there all night, probably because they pay so poorly and late. Find a real company, one with integrity and one you can actually contact with a problem. This one is full of broke peasant employees with no sense of decency or community.",1,REe6i6DTsm0Q8cegDdncYQ
"So...I have been back to Mayo twice since my initial visit. The first procedure went well, yes I loved having the happy drugs and don't recall much from that day. My friends enjoyed my behavior and thanks to them I arrived safely at home that afternoon. What I do like about Mayo is the consistency and promptness. For this particular appointment I checked in, they made copies of my medical power of attorney and living will. Yes, they actually stated to bring it if I had one. Thank goodness I took care of that back in 2001!!! I had the same nurse the entire time, that way you do form a bond and there is a level of trust. Again, as in the initial visit, when I entered the room the Dr., although a different one, was waiting for me. He discussed everything in great detail. They took a all quiet, the Dr. reiterated what was being done and everyone had to say ""check"" including me. Though I thought it was strange, it leaves little room for error if we are all on the same page. All went well and this test showed normalcy! Yeah! 

Then I went back again the other day. Well let's just say I couldn't not complete the test. It had nothing to do with Mayo at all, just me. My body was not cooperating. My Dr. called me within the hour to say he had been notified. He wanted to reassure me that it was OK, and we would discuss it at greater length in his office on my follow-up appointment. If I had any questions or concerns to feel free to call him at any time. Now that is a surprising change and I just loved it. Yes, I have not been feeling all too well since that day, but...",5,a1xb8dpxHNnOZCukpOsePg

"We had our very old and worn anthony pool resurfaced with micro pebble by AZ Pool and Spa Restoration. Don came and explained what we needed and gave two options to fit our budget. We chose AZ Pool & Spa because of a reasonable price, the length of warranty but mostly the professionalism of Don during our quote. Don explained things really well, but it wasn't in a condescending tone that women can sometimes get from contractors. He made me feel completely at ease and was very sweet when he learned I was recovering from breast cancer- saying that the pool would be great for my healing in a geniunely positive and not salesman way. We scheduled the chip out and the team that came were great. They worked quickly and kept the area clean as they worked. 
Other reviews have said that the communication was bad- I had the complete opposite experience! We were doing some of the work ourselves (tile and plumbing) and if I had any questions, Don responded very quickly; offering advice on the work we were doing ourselves. He didn't need to do that but he wanted to make sure we had information to ensure the renovation was the best it could be. Offering hints to my husband like pressurizing our new pipes until last minute so we could see if there were any leaks before we backfilled them. (great tip-worked great!) 
We do have a very old anthony pool (about 50 yrs) so when the chip out was done, we found a lot of rusted rebar. Don had warned us ahead that was what Mike was going to inspect during the shell inspection after chip out, so I wasn't given any ""sticker shock"" when we needed to brownout our bottom and have some rusted rebar replaced. He was very upfront about the cost before we did chip out so those that say they were never told or had costs added on, perhaps weren't listening close enough during quote phase? 
After brown coat, Don was ready when we were. We just had to finish tile and let him know. We finished over the weekend and I texted him to let him know we were ready for the pebble finish. He was able to schedule for Monday! Again, opposite of what other reviews have said.
I'm an early riser and told Don his guys could come as early as they wanted to hopefully avoid being too long in the sun. They were at my drive at 6.30am ready to start! Watching these guys work was something else (not hovering!) they were so professional and quick and again, kept the area clean. They did leave their slurry container outside after they left but after chatting with Don, I learned that it had to harden and they would pick up the next day, which they did.
Next day they came to acid wash the pebble and again, quick and professional. After the guy left, Don called to let me know about filling the pool and what we had to do.
The pool took two days to fill. Mike, the other owner came by to put chemicals in. He gave a run down of what we needed to do for the first 30 days and some advice for thereafter. Again, in a non condescending way. 
These two gentlemen were great to work with. They were respectful and professional. I had no problems with communication, no issues with the work done and an absolutely beautiful pool ready just in time for summer! 
Thank you so much Mike and Don. I will be recommending you in the future!",5,ugWLElUlcncJI6V1g396mQ
"What could you not love about this mall?

1.) parking is super easy and available on several sides of the property so that you can more quickly and efficiency reach the stores you're looking for. Call a store and ask if you should come in through Fashion Show Dr or Spring Mountain Rd, etc... It's easy :)

2.) the store selection here is a shoppers heaven. From the top fashion and luxury brands to places most of us need to visit every now and then like the Apple Store, it's all there.

3.) they have a brand new app you can download to always be aware of some of the latest specials going on, or simply see their directory of restaurants, stores, and more, all in one spot! :) I'm all about saving time and this app does just that for a shopper. 

4. The mall is super clean and always got a great energy about it. Ever shipped at a mall where the atmosphere was just dead? Yea, Fashion Show is the opposite of that, you come alive there when you visit. Maybe it's the shopping euphoria that hits you, but either way you'll see how beautiful a mall this is when you visit.

5. and lastly I'd just say plan to spend a while here. I recommend starting at the Starbucks so you have plenty of energy for the day. :) 

Enjoy everyone! I hope my tips and review help you. Happy Shopping :)

"Was in town recently for a death in the family. Hands down the best coffee in Chandler. The space is the typical trendy style - concrete floors, metal, sparse, but also warm with those giant windows. That leather couch was very comfy and I spent hours there. The people and atmosphere were convivial and pleasant. The staff was AWESOME! Maybe its my coming from the East Coast, but these young people were gracious, efficient and very customer oriented.

"This review is for the BBQ restaurant in the Ellis Island.  I've been hearing about this place for years, and heard nothing but great things, so I had to give it a try.  I was told to sign up for their player's card and you can get a full rack of ribs for $15 with sides.  We got their late on a Wednesday night and ordered one of their large $2 draft beers and a full rack.  After maybe 5 minutes this HUGE plate came out with a full rack and a side of slaw, BBQ beans and bread.  The ribs fell off the bone and had very good flavor.  The slaw was average, but the beans were very good!  It was too much food, but I couldn't leave a bone with meat on it!  If you're in Vegas and was good BBQ at a great price, Ellis Island is a place to go.  Plus the machines are good also!!!",4,QfPqX98bamZDSTMoZEJY-Q
"Enjoyed our first dinner at Echo 5 last night. Not knowing much about the restaurant I knew we were in a good place once I seen the Marine Corps sticker on the front door; later I learned the own is a Marine.  Which is where the name comes from. ""Semper Fi sir""

As a picky food person I found their food pretty dang good. The fries need a make over however the fish was good and everything we have on one of the appetizer platers was cook amazing. First place I've been to in a while where I felt satisfied when I let. Our waiter was awesome to and had a very fun personality.",5,Iq_umt_W5AF6t4qbcWs1rQ
"Stayed here this past weekend for 5 days/4 nights .

FYI $28 resort fee here per day and rooms were about $55 with tax 

Upon check in- no rooms available 'with my requested type' (NS King- regular room- ) so we were placed into a two queen bed room for the night. (wasnt happy about that- my BF is larger- we were pretty squooshed in that bed!)

Next day we had to try to get the 'right room' and had to stand in line at desk to do so (1/2 hour wait) and they gave us another room as they had said they would.

Usually , in all the other hotels in Vegas they would upgrade or comp you something to try to make amends that first night- They didnt- and should have- moving rooms was a pain in the butt. I spoke with the front desk staff she was very "" I could give a rats ass if you stay here or not' and when I spoke with the manager on duty-even she didnt seem to care if I was unhappy or not.That fake smile was so annoying.

Its not like the entire hotel was full- it was New years Day-everyone was checking OUT. 

Take note TI from Caesars,NYNY, and even CircusCircus - who have all done that ! Ive been to Las Vegas at least 10 times...Really TI?

Room was pretty standard-nothing spectacular- but bathroom and tub were nice size.
Halls were really quiet and room was on 22nd floor with decent view.

The entrance where the check in is could use some updating- the colors are old and seventies and still a bit of that 'Pirate' flair which they look like they are moving away from.(and should - its not a daycare - its a hotel)",3,l5tHohU6CgopwNc25b3Law

I have been a patient of Dr Harlan's for a number of years and have always received nothing but the best medical care possible.  I have had everything from minor problems to a complete ankle reconstruction.  The best thing I can say is that Dr Harlan gives it to you straight.  He does not tell you what you want to hear but gives you the honest facts so you can make an informed decision.  He told me how long my recovery was going to be and he was dead on.  My office appointments have always been on time which is very important to me as like most people I am busy too.  I have never felt rushed during my visit and have always left with all the answers to my questions.  I have recommended family and friends to Dr Harlan and will continue to do so!,5,6MHJTcn0GLmFfzHfhk25GA
"The price was more than other places, but Kevin was recommended to me by the person who had recently replaced my cracked windshield, so I opted to pay more, thinking the service would be better. When I picked up my vehicle a large spot had begun to lift up on one of the back windows. He heated the outside of the window with a torch and used a squeegee before sending me on my way. Two weeks later and there is still a crease where this bubble had been.

A week after initially getting the tint done on all of my windows, I had to go back to get my windshield and one of my side windows redone. There are still bubbles under all of the windows. When I asked about this I was told it takes up to two weeks to dry and evaporate completely. I was originally told 48 hours.

He was nice and was willing to replace my windshield tint no questions asked. However, I received a little push back when I asked to have my driver door redone because there were multiple felt pieces from the doorframe under the tint. I was told ""yeah, I mean I can redo it, but nothings going to be perfect.""

For damn dear $500 it better be damn near perfect.",1,UqtH4J9yV74GdP3nGLsu3Q
"If I could give ZERO stars, I would. This place is disgusting and overpriced. To set the stage, the owners' Visas expired and they had to leave the country. So management is a joke and upkeep of the property is non-existent.  The place is outdated and the equipment is from the 90s. Most of the spinning bikes don't have the ability for a rider to clip in and some don't even allow you to adjust the bike for safe riding. Pedaling is clicky and doesn't have a smooth circular motion. Bathrooms are foul. The ceilings are consistently leaking so part of your workout includes walking the halls and dodging the garbage cans set up to collect the water. The members, specifically the silver sneakers, are incredibly rude and it's not a place anyone would want to spend time. The ONLY thing the club had going for it was when it brought in an outside fitness studio and offered AWESOME and uplifting classes where you literally forgot you were dancing in a shitty gym. They've since left and so have I, and I would say that everyone is much happier. The club sucks. Don't go.",1,ohFdY3hUqRJkBnRNX9BmUQ
"VIBE
Right across from Summerhill Station is the best salon you didn't even know about: The Alcorn! When you walk in, the all white interior is complemented by stunning fashion photography featuring owner Tony Masciangelo's work. I also love the big wooden table on the upstairs floor. Make sure you get a tour. Staff are welcoming and professional. 

THE GOODS 
This is the place where fashion editors get their hair done and I was in good hands with Jed for my highlights. My rusty roots had taken its toll and Jed freshened em right up so they looked as golden as new. Jed is super talkative and friendly and I'd go back just to have a chat with him. I know a lot of people who rave about Tony's cuts but I haven't had the pleasure yet.

"We live in New York City but were visiting family in Madison. On a suggestion of a friend we went to Merchant which, as described, was a  restaurant / grocery / craft bar similar (in concept) to Jeffrey's Grocery in NYC (Joseph Leonard's).

While my wife and I were unimpressed by Jeffrey's Grocery in NYC, we absolutely loved Merchant. The food, atmosphere and craft bar would put Merchant among the top ""casual"" fine dining places in NYC.... and this place is in Madison.  

Here is a New York City description of Merchant.  Put the Spotted Pig together with Le Pain Quotidien, Wichcraft and Employees Only craft bar and you would have something like Merchant.

We went for lunch and had the cured pork with fresh mozzerella and pickled onions. For dinner we had the roast chicken and trout.  The food was outrageously good.  

The only question I have is when Merchant will expand to NYC.

"Best high end pool party venue in Vegas hands down. I believe it is also the largest pool on the strip. I've seen Afrojack and Deadmau5 spin at EBC and it's always been a good time. They get the best EDM DJ's in the world here(just like Marquee Day Club), so if you like pool parties and EDM this is the place to be. They have DJ's such as Tiesto, Avicii, Deadmau5, Afrojack, Steve Angello, Calvin Harris, Deniz Koyu...

Entry:
I can't stress this enough: Buy presale tickets online! If you know you are going to go beforehand, just do it. It'll save you lots of $$, about 50% off what you would pay at the door. You'll save lots of time waiting in line as well. The one time we didn't buy online presale tix, we had to wait in a super long line to get in the day of and it took forever. After waiting for over an hour and not moving very much we decided to do what you always do if you don't want to wait: Grease the bouncers. So we greased him a Benjamin and we finally got to the front where we then had to pay the full price which was something like $125 each. Ridiculous! If we had bought our tix online it would have been like $60. You can bring in a backpack but you can't bring in any outside food or drink and they inspect it very thoroughly. You cannot bring in eye drops or any medication. You will need to check it in at the front and then go back to get it if you need it. 

Environment:
Unlike Marquee Day Club, there is plenty of space to find an area to sit either on the edge of the pool or on the side by one of the planters. The capacity of EBC is probably 3 times the size of Marquee Day Club, so it seems much more relaxed. Be warned, the music is very loud because they have speakers surrounding the entire pool which is actually quite impressive. I think I counted something like 80 speakers surrounding the pool all along the walls. Because of this there isn't really any place you can go where the music is not loud, so if you need a break from the noise you'll need to leave the pool or bring ear plugs. Since the pool is so large, you can easily find a place to take a quick dip on either side or in the middle in front of the DJ.  There is an area to dance in front of the DJ as well. 

Food/Drink:
Drinks are ridiculously expensive which is expected at any Vegas club, almost $20 per drink after tax and tip. However food is actually pretty good here, and costs much less than alcohol! The chicken sandwich/wrap is what I order every single time. They also sell soda, powerade, water, and beer at the food window. The line usually moves much faster than the line at the bar, so if you just want a beer or soda or water, this is a good place to go. 

One complaint about this place... the security is not very good, but as expected they probably are just temporary workers, not permanent. One time I was drinking my powerade and a head of security lady came up to me and told me I wasn't allowed to bring in outside food or drink and told me to throw it away. As you can imagine I was very confused since I had paid like $5 for it at the food window! So I argue with her for a little while and she still doesn't believe me so then my friends have to come and back me up and tell her that I really bought it at the food window, along with beer, water etc. Obviously she did not know what drinks they actually sold at the food window so she finally gave up and believed us. 

EBC sets the standard for how all other pool parties in Vegas should be, which is why I gave it 5 stars. People who give it four stars are just complaining about the service or price of drinks, but wtf do they expect? And where else is there a better pool party in Vegas? Marquee is the only other pool party that compares because they get all the popular DJ's too, and all the really hot model girls go there. But Marquee is way smaller, super cramped and crowded and the drinks cost just as much.",5,Pmh_X_nK1eMd0oNcQGqoIQ

"Very good selection beyond traditional Korean barbecue here. Very fresh food and very clean place. Good energy.  

We had the premium meal for two. The food comes real fast and before you know it, you're done. But with plenty of leftovers. Wagyu was nicely fresh and marbled, but tough.  The salad was awesome and fresh.  Shrimp was so so, kimchis were also so so.  Very Americanized meal.

Seating in the booths was very uncomfortable. So if there is an other option, I suggest you choose a table. Booths have very hard wooden seats with semi soft backing that was also WAY too far away from the table. Awkward seating situation that made us squirm through the meal.

They promote that you get a free dessert if you rate them on Yelp, which I think, contributes to the ratings here. They don't require a high rating, but would you eat a dessert after you show them that you just gave them a bad review? Nope.",3,7P7WzeTCbvZIl6y-GVX6pA

The BX here is really nice, I wish they'd ID more people though, there were a LOT of people that should have not been using the BX, but whatever. I like the furniture store, but in true AAFEES fashion, its over priced and 100$ for delivery. 

The Commisarry is great, if I didn't live closer to Creech, I would shop here more often, maybe as gas prices continue to drop, I'll shop here more often. Great prices for meat and produce. I wish they'd limit the coupons here, these coupon hoarders come through here to clear out shelves.

"Day after Christmas stores were overloaded with people looking for bargains, going to the movies, and eating out. We fell in the later category. Lucky, we found a parking space close to the restaurant. At home Red Robin is our go-to sit-down restaurant for burgers. 

Inside was packed, with no waiting in the pub. For two people the pub was perfect. The waitress appeared almost the moment we sat down. Ordered. Food came quick, hot ... happy to satisfy growing hunger pains. 

Hubby ordered Chicken salad. No surprises.  My fish and steak fries satisfied. 

At the table sat a computerized screen for paying the bill. LOVE it. Not only could we pay (with auto calculating tip meter), we used it to call the waitress for more salad dressing. No more hailing down harried wait staff. LOVE IT! And, before leaving, we answered a pretty lengthy online review, something I probably wouldn't have taken time for once I got home.

"We had 14 people in our party and China Poblano was excellent for a large group. It was a Tuesday night and the restaurant was slammed, yet service was still very good.

We ordered everything from beers to margaritas to tacos to pork buns to fried rice. I tried a bite of everything. The stand outs for me were:

-Pollo con mole taco
-Cochinita taco
-Tuna ceviche

Our waitress was very accomodating and helpful. The restaurant also allowed us to bring in our own dessert for the occasion. 

I know some reviewers have commented on how expensive they think China Poblano is for the food, but for us it was a great deal. Our bill totaled a little over $700 for 14 people, including alcohol and gratuity, which averaged around $50/person. Not bad at all considering it was a nice, fun meal with delicious food that lasted over 2 hours.

It's not my favorite restaurant in the Cosmo nor is it my go-to spot for tacos but for a fun, casual place to eat on that property I think China Poblano is a very solid choice.",4,IRGQqOhNFilEdXZqugjmAA

My Yolan Cris custom made dress arrived 3 weeks late to me in San Francisco, making it impossible to get alterations done in time for my wedding in Ohio.  My mother tried everyone there, but it was bridal season and everyone was swamped. I was so doubtful of things working out that I bought a back up dress. My mother and I had almost given up, when she made her final hail mary and contacted I Do Bride. The owner was busy too, but she miraculously made time to get my dress done.

You can't really complain because the shops at Pacific Mall are made of glass walls.

"I echo some of the other reviewers by saying that this is my favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas. I don't usually like to go to the strip to eat, unless it's a special occasion, but Tamba is worth it. It is very upscale in decor, yet has good ethnic flavor to it as well. Waiters are attentive, but not overly so (which I hate).

The buffet choices are excellent and all food is fresh and warm and tasty! 

The only drawback...it is closed for a couple of hours before dinner time (I belive 5:30PM or so?) I like my dinner early sometimes, and it was a bid of a disappintement.

"My wife and I were roaming the industrial and business park area of Phoenix looking for a decent bite to eat, preferably Mexican food. We finally stumbled upon a set of about five Mexican eateries. We decided on Salsitas, which seems to be a chain in the Valley of The Sun.

I wished that the woman had done a better job of speaking and understanding English. The food order was correct, and plentiful, not to mention cheap, but we had specifically asked for forks and were not given any. I had to go to our hotel's front deck and beg the clerk for a couple of plastic forks. 

The burrito was huge and very tasty. I had a couple of Grilled Chicken mini-tacos, and while they were pretty good, they were nothing special and I even found a few pieces of gristle. My wife had a chicken burrito and said it was huge and very good. She could not finish it. They also gave us some hot carrots so that scored well with her.

Ten bucks for all of that, including four salsas and sour cream. Not bad, but I'd like to try more.",3,lfTQQujTDReGLs3BOzJBvw
"If there was an option for zero stars, it would be a more accurate review. 

To keep this short, M&T had blocked two of my friends due to the ""sporty"" nature of their loafers (remember, this is Charlotte, the cultural hotbed of the southeast). They were enforcing a dress code expecting 100% of their patrons to be dressed in cocktail attire, as this is what the normal Charlottean looks like on a Thursday night. 

Once we made it past the bouncers, the bar itself was underwhelming, close to empty, and took forever to make overpriced drinks and undercooked food.

No other seasoning, and the salsa flavors didn't even blend well with the bland main. Couldn't they at least add beans? Cilantro? Anything else to make it even worth the $9? 

I'm giving this place two stars only because the employees were friendly. My friends liked their food, and it sounds like the breakfast burrito with chorizo was good.

"Typical Shady Insurance Practices. 

I've been using Progressive for a few months now and have been pleased with the service, but recently moved to a different town with my partner (also from the same town) and was pleased to find that they reduced her monthly insurance rate by nearly a hundred dollars because they were claiming that the town we were moving to was a safer place. Within a couple days I was notified of a change in my insurance payment as well but was surprised to find that it was nearly a hundred dollars HIGHER than it usually is. I call customer service and after being transferred around between a few people who had no clue what they were doing I was linked up with a gentleman who informed me that I now have an increased payment do to the ZIP code that I now reside in being more dangerous and high risk (opposite of the reason my girlfriend's payment was dropped). Not to mention a couple of months ago we both got a letter of non-renewal form the company only to find out upon calling that it was yet another mistake from their end that led them to think that I had moved to Texas, yet when I looked outside it seemed to me that I was still in Oregon...............

Long story short, I thought that I had found a good company to have insurance coverage with at last, but it turns out that Progressive is just as willing to lie and twist the reality that is insurance liability and risk to whatever form best fits THEIR needs.

I've already canceled my policy and as someone who is in the automotive industry I have no problem steering the customers in need that I meet away from Progressive when they ask for my recommendation.",1,19t8qG5e2SNMPjtOTyR32A

"First of all, this is a cafeteria style eating setup.  There are multiple food ""stands"" here, and you eat in a small area that is shared with others.  Not a big deal to me, but don't expect BWW or other establishment.  It is a cool idea though, more for college kids I think, since it is right near CSN.  

Ordered the fried pickles, jalapeno bombers, and traditional wings of course.

Pickles were good...it is the sauce that makes them actually.  The pickles by themselves didn't do much for me, but the cajun/mayo/ranch whatever it was is pretty solid and goes well with the vinegary/saltiness.  Jalapeno bombers were not very good....pretty bland...would not recommend.

As for the wings, I saw them cook the entire batch at one time.  But somehow, some of them got overcooked and dry, others were absolutely perfect.  There were some with a lot of blood vessels or whatever it is called, and one of mine had a broken bone with marrow all around the insides and chunks of bone pieces...yuck.  These must be frozen and transported via UPS freight (jk...kind of)....

Tried the parm garlic, mango habenero (I think), and carribean jerk bbq.  The garlic parm was ok...the habenero was like a basic hot to me...both were good, but not great.  What WAS great was their carribean jerk.  It was an excellent, spicy mixture of bbq and jerk'ness and really really wish all the others had that much thought and love put into them.

Since all the other reviews seemed great, I must have had a bad experience or bad choices in sauce at least.  If the wings were cooked right, it would have made this a 4 star, and more than one solid choice in flavor, would have bumped another outta me.  I guess I will stick with the chain restaurants for solid and consistent wings.",3,PIgB3NVHexFDv16ORgC0xg

Well as soon as I leave I double checked because one bud was the entire eighth and sure enough they made me pay high for low lol but besides all that when I switched them out for the right one I opened it up and the ""Top Shelf"" was still soaking wet like they didn't even let it dry or cure. If you want just about the worst stuff in Vegas this is your go to place!",5,e5r8lMWY7-nCSslVoqZOgA
Quick service food has its own great taste very nicely surprised,5,9NnQB6pdA_vfNZhWb0Ez3w
"Don't ask me how I found this place. It's in a residential place of Las Vegas. 

Randomly say down with some friends of mine that had been recommended this place and we came and sat at the sushi bar. The owner?? (Chef John) served us and we started with the sampler platter and worked our way down the menu. We had uni, Tuna Takaki salad, cucumber salad and just about everything else and ended with fresh mochi and a green tea Cree brûlée. Right??  

I'll just make a long story short. After driving 8 hours, being 9:00 at night it was the perfect way to end a great day. 

Find your way here and you won't regret it...and ask for Chef John if you really want VIP service. If you speak Taiwanese  you might even get a break on dessert :)",5,TMruxFxIwxLQWMtWxx3h5Q
Awful service. It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive. My medium rare steak was so tough my knife bounced off it. Grilled cheese was congealed...it was gross. Waitress never came over to say kitchen was backed up.  It was also so cold with the a/c on that I had to order tea to keep warm. Manager did come over once summoned and was really no help. Avoid if possible.,1,7-qi5LQnjjJJ-mVCuUgtig
"I'm sitting here at the restaurant as a type this. Greeting was good, waiter helped me out as soon as I got seated. The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way was that he started telling me about the prices of the food. Other than that he was cool. I ordered the mahi tacos. Pretty good, they could have held the dry lettuce. This lettuce was mad dry and old. Just take glimpse of the photo.",3,W-9LV2n4CjRMzXdLiqbsxA
"Great food and service. Modern and urban decor sure to please the young profesional crowd. Beef tartare and salmon were a treat!!

The service was also excellent, very attentive yet discrete.",5,r2VTeuqAV84Jh1odS1g6TQ
"This place just opened Saturday. I had a 6 PC spicy chicken strip combo. Came with fries and some toast. The food was good 

They have free wifi",4,JAlh2-s06XwkBzu8FXeAkQ
"Fun atmosphere. It was nice having actual good sushi in a casual environment. The best deal IMO are the Vento box combos. 

Also, you must get their s'more milk shake. It saves lives!",4,iGBUVRXzDOyoWSedih5JFQ
"No! No! No! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.
If they have 0 star I will give it to them. I went there and eat with my family. I found 3 different pieces sushi have hair in it!
I show it to the waitress and she gave it to the manager. They didn't do anything. They should shut this place down. Horrible!",1,uPwlSMeI-wvW3UtRGqScKQ
"No vegetables?  Not an onion, a pepper?

Overall a very boring selection.  No wonder I was the only one there",2,NTMMofRyHIN1aAwwp3xdRA
"When they called to set up our appointment it was for the following Friday. (It was a Tuesday). Luckly, I was able to get the time off and left early for the 10-2PM appt time. At 2pm i had to call to make sure the technician was on the way. He had been hung up at the previous appt longer than he estimated. But, there was no thought on calling his next scheduled appts at all. 
When the technician started troubleshooting I explained that we had had the Freon serviced less than 5 months ago. He topped of the freon and called it good. Sunday, we noticed that dripping water out of the intake vents again, which were FULL of water dripping from the FROZEN coil, again. We called the Home Warrantee company to recall the trouble call which they could not do because Cool Blew did not close the work order. Then, when they called back after the home warrantee company issued a recall order they couldn't schedule it for another 3 days. For work they did not complete. 
With children and pets in the house its amazing they cannot back up their own work. Call someone else, Cold Blew couldn't give a lick about your 100 degree house even after they ""repaired"" the A/C.",1,auJ3tOHWVN593s48gMEZAA

"My girlfriend and I just ate here for the first time today. The customer service of the staff gets a 5/5, they were friendly and helpful. The food gets a 3.5/5 (I gave it a 3, my gf gave it a 4). We both got the turkey bacon avocado lunch sandwich with no mustard. It was a bit dry, would have been better with a little ranch. I'm excited to try the breakfast sandwich next time. The interior was awesome, all open to the patio (its November so the weather was beautiful). Very cute. Overall, 4/5. I would suggest this place.",4,xqo9xCZgK2Ws0tcRcJltJg
You are always out of hummus. Fix that problem because your hummus veggie wrap is pretty good and you've lost our business on many occasions. It makes me not want to even try coming back. I tried calling ahead of time to make sure you have hummus and your phone number is wrong. Get it together.,2,tKb2ykTDFsJoFDYTOElaVA
So excited to have a location 10 min from our house! The young teens at the drivethru  window were very friendly. These doughnuts were as yummy as ever!! Especially if you go during a HOT time.. Hot glazed doughnuts beween 6am-9am and 6pm-10pm!,5,AHTrKUsbd6z2t1vzilLm3g
