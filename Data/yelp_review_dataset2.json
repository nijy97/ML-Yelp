    "text": "While I have had several average salon and spa services at Holts this review is for my hair coloring experiences with Ina.\n\nI have had my blonde highlights done by Ina on and off for a few years. I was always very happy with the results, yet I was kept trying to look for a more reasonably priced place because it is very expensive indeed (in my case about $300 with the toner and blow dry, which is not included).\n\nAnd so it was that a month before my wedding I went to a very reputable downtown salon (supposedly the best in to) to have my highlights done. To make a very long and painful story short, my hair was butchered, orange, brassy, horrible. I did actually cry...so I went to Ina, to see if she could do anything to fix it, and she did. It was a very, very! long process; she put in new highlights and once the foils were in brushed with darker dye the rest of my hair, strand my strand...the result was absolutely amazing.\n\nThe bottom line is: she is good. She knows what to mix to get an ashy shade, she knows what will match your skin tone, she knows how thick/ think the highlights should be, where they should be...so I have decided that I would rather have my hair highlighted twice a year rather than every 3 months, but go to Ina rather than hopelessly keep trying to find a colorist that knows what they are doing.",

I used some products that they recommended but nothing seemed to help.\nA friend recommended Sara D so I made an appointment with her hoping that she would be able to make some suggestions for my dry and damaged hair. She suggested one product and gave me tips for drying and styling that would help. Since that first visit, my hair has come along way. Sara always gives me suggestions for keeping my hair healthy and she'll recommend different products in the store but never pushes me to purchase a product. She always asks what my budget is and what I'm looking to have done so that I'm not disappointed with the outcome. I'd highly recommend Sara - or any of the other stylists.",

    "text": "I recieved a dozen chocolate cover strawberries from the Decatur location on May 6th. After we came home from dinner I got out my box they smelled amazing but the strawberry was mushy and already sitting in liquid.  By Saturday morning they were mushy, soggy, messy strawberries sitting in over 70% liquid, just a large not edible mess.  I tried calling on Sumday and got hung up on over and over again.  On Monday I finally got a person on the phone.  I was told there was no manager available.  I explained the issue and she told me sorry you must of got a bad box.  She offered to replace the strawberries, but at this point I didn't want more strawberries concerned I would get more of the same.  I asked if I could get either bananas, pineapple or apples.  They had a box for less money with a mix of strawberries, bananas and pineapple, which I was interested in.  She explained they had been so busy over the weekend they had NO fruit.  This was after 12 in the afternoon, surely they should have gotten a delivery and if not for emergencies run to the grocery store right next door.  I said it didn't have to be today but I guess they never expected another delivery of fruit ever again.  She said the only thing she could do was refund the person who paid which was my mother in law.  I hung up and called my mother in law and told her I loved her idea but they were horrible and they would be contacting her for info so they could refund her.  It's now five days later and no one has called her for the refund and I never got anything edible.  They are liars and thieves.  If you want your special day for that special person messed up this is the place to call.  I have called back today but still no manager.  This was edible arrangements located at 1291 s. Decatur Blvd. 140, Las Vegas, NV 89102 phone 702-822-4469.  \nAbsolutely the worst customer service and product I have ever recieved for my birthday.  Thank you for screwing it up and showing me you don't run a reputable or honest business.",

But the MOST important thing for me was the security. EVERY security person I interacted with was incredibly kind. I've been to many venues in the valley and they always have these macho bro-ed out dudes that are rude and pushy, but NOT here at the Van Buren. They were all so nice and orderly, I have never experienced that at a music venue. The one 'bad' thing I'd say is the woman who was running the seating on the mezzanine takes her job WAY too seriously and could not be bothered about anything, even when we had questions, but that one negative isn't deterring me from still leaving a 5 star review for everything else. Can't wait to see another show here, I know I'll be treated kindly by the bartenders and security peeps! Thank you!",

    "text": "I came back to Agio last night (a year later) from my last review. Most of my previous review still stands, but I definitely had a wonderful experience which is why I give this 5/5. This is not your typical, fast paced restaurant. The chef really makes each meal from scratch and alone, so yes, your meal in a bigger group or depending what you order may come out first before the others. It's definitely a homey feel. You really need to have patience if you want to eat here. For my experience, I thought the pace was great since we ordered lots!\n\nI made a 7pm reservation for Friday, and when I arrived only a table of 6 were in the restaurant. The server was really kind, and she gave us her recommendations. I had called in advance to ask for 2 orders of the lobster risotto, since I had a few colleagues rave about it recently and thought I just had to try. We also ordered caprese salad, fried calamari, linguine alla vongole - clams in white wine pesto sauce, spaghetti and meatballs, as well as the mushroom gnocchi. Yes - this many dishes shared between 4 people. We started with bread, as well as an app on the house (grilled zucchini with squash on top). Everything was delicious. I would prefer to try the grilled calamari next time though. In terms of the lobster risotto, it's not a traditional risotto but made in tomato sauce. If you love lobster, this dish or the lobster pasta is your ideal meal. It comes with a whole lobster! I would also recommend the linguine with clams, and the mushroom gnocchi was so delicious. Tasted fresh, and full of flavour.\n\nAt the end of our meal, the Chef also gave us creme brulee on the house - also the best creme brulee I've ever had. Just the perfect crust, and the dessert itself wasn't overly sweet. I'll definitely be back and hopefully it would take me a year to do so. This place is a gem!",

IT WILL SAVE YOU FROM HAVING TO WRITE REVIEWS LIKE THIS.\n\nI went to Home Depot last weekend to purchase two Rheem water heaters. I was advised that Parker and Sons was the company used to install Home Depot water heaters. The technician came to my house this morning, conducted a 5 minute walk through of both existing water heaters then spent 20 minutes in his truck writing an estimate. The estimate was $5,538! When I asked the technician how in the world the price could be so high, he responded, \"that's our pricing on \"\"our\"\" water heaters. I told him this estimate was set up by Home Depot not Parker and Sons. He continued to tell me the pricing was for Parker and Sons water heaters. The water heater from Home Depot was $850 each, how could Parker and Sons charge an additional approx. $2,000 per unit to install? They said it was to bring my current water heater up to code and pull a permit.  I called the city of Scottsdale and they informed me the only cost that would be needed was a water pressure valve ($14) and a permit ($44). The remaining items on my current units are up to code and would easily pass in inspection. Parker and Sons pays it's technicians commission for every job they are on. They will try to increase the price to receive that commission. This is a predatory business practice. Just look at all the reviews on Parker and Sons, they are almost all based on being mislead and over charged.\n\nUPDATE: Angie, please read my entire review prior to responding next time. My main complaint isn't just pricing. I called this estimate through Home Depot to purchase a water heater from Home Depot. The technician quoted me a Parker and Sons water heater based on Parker and Sons pricing, not Home Depot pricing. There is no need to have a supervisor call me. I've already spoken with Paul Kelly, owner of Parker and Sons this morning.  I will leave our conversation of the review but I can assure everyone reading this review that I addressed my concern regarding the technician and company of this predatory business practice. He assured me he will investigate and follow up with me. \n\nUPDATE: I just received an estimate to install from Huntington Home Improvement for $750, all parts and haul away of both old units included.",

Since my visits were literally separated by a year, it's good to see that this place has staying power.\n\nLocated in Uptown, it is definitely an experience to go eat here.  Both birthday dinner times were with a large crowd 8-10 and we had reservations.  Once everyone arrived, we were promptly sat at our table and the servers got our drink orders and food orders.  The chef/entertainer comes out and confirms all our orders and then starts cooking right in front of us.\n\nI'm a sucker for showmanship, but the chefs pull out all the tricks:  flaming onion volcano, fake ketchup bottle squirting, etc.  Probably the funnest thing is when the chef offers everyone some sake and proceeds to squirt the sake in peoples mouths until they had enough.  This latest visit was the entire table catching broccoli in their mouths...\n\nGood times -  The staff are really good here keeping your drinks flowing and catering to your needs.

We were just walking around trying to find clubs to go to so we had nothing to lose. It's located in the back alley behind Fatburger, kinda sketchy location. We went in and they were playing house, I was like Ooo yeah, it's on!! They DJ played great music, however there wasn't many people there. My friends and I just formed a circle and housed/breaked most of the time, some other people would come up in our circle and session with us too. If there were more people, it'd be a lot better. I believe it's open from 2:00am until 8:00am. We came on a Thursday night, however when we came on a Saturday night, it wasn't free. I think it was about 5:00am, sun almost out, and they were charging a cover. The open bar was cool on Thursday night, however the drinks were pretty watered down. It has potential to be good, but I dunno how many people party that late. I was getting tired by 5:00am-6:00am.",

The truffles had two salted, one of which was milk chocolate.  They were so salty that the chocolate flavor did not come through.  I have to assume that the chocolate with  name brand wrappers are better than the ones they make in house.",

    "text": "Disappointing return visit reminds us that a restaurant can change very quickly depending on food quality and service.\n\nOur 2nd time here, we had a very curt and unfriendly waiter who forgot to refill drinks, forgot cutlery, mixed up orders and finally delivered ice cream that was inexplicably savory.\n\nThis is an all you can eat and cook Korean style restaurant where you order your raw proteins, cook on the burner in your table and enjoy.  You might imagine that you can begin to enjoy cooking unless you have utensils but our waiter, constantly running between tables, had this annoying reply to our requests \"I will get it later, ok?\"\n\nFood quality was mixed. The beef and short ribs were good. The sushi was fast and seemingly well prepared. There was a white fish that disintegrated into a mush when cooked - we suspected it had gone bad. Little shot glass servings of ice cream - you have a choice of mango or green tea - were presented to us without spoons (later, ok?) and ended up spit-out-savory as in \"what the hell kind of ice cream was that?\"\n\nOur meal concluded with a bill that included a 10% service charge which our waiter explained went to the restaurant but that he would only get whatever we tipped him. Wtf? I've been to restaurants that automatically add a tip to parties of 6 or more but the waiter doesn't ask for another cut.\n\nFortunately there are a lot of Korean grill restaurants in Toronto - if Chaco doesn't get their act together (the place was half empty on a sat night), they're not going to be around for the long run.",

It was our first time there and only discovered the code today, so it couldn't of been us.  He refused to compare my phone number to the number he claimed made the previous orders.\n\nAnyways, it was a terrible customer service experience and I left empty handed after 20 long minutes at the restaurant.  The kid was rude and unhelpful, and honestly think he made up the excuse because he wanted to close up shop.  It's the last time I'm stepping foot in the restaurant until the service improves, they've got to realize there are TONS of other pizza options around the neighbourhood.",

I decided to stop by, since walk ins are available. \nThe decoration and atmosphere was very cute and bright. I really enjoy going to nail salons that are welcoming and bright. \nI went during my lunch break asking if they could take me in. I didn't have to wait which was a major plus since I only had a hour break. \nThey offer a lot of different varieties of color and shades! \nThe service itself is great, but the execution was done poorly. I'm usually not very picky when it comes to people doing my nails. However, I felt like I was doing my own nails. The gel wasn't painted evenly and I have random extra paint on some nails. \nWhen I was done I noticed a part of my nail wasn't even painted. When I told them they quickly apologized and offered to fix it. Usually my gel manicures cost $35 without tip, but they only charge $30 for a basic gel manicure. I rather spend an extra five dollars for a better job. \nIt's very unfortunately, but I most likely will not be returning. I do appreciate their service and walk ins.",

    "text": "We ate at Franco's tonight for the second time.  Tonight I started off with Chicken Pastina soup. It was better than my Grandma's recipe straight from Italy.  That is saying a lot. Next I split  two dinners with my Father because we could not decide. The Virgina Spots(Sea Bass) were outstanding. Small portion but I was expecting that when you order spots.  My Dad got the Veal special with 2 large shrimp. My Dad doesn't eat shrimp so it was a bonus for me.  They were cooked in some sort of light red sauce. I don't remember what it was called. It seemed to be a mix between tomato and Marsala. Not sure what the veal was like because my Dad did not share, which is unusual for him. The only reason for the 4 stars is the food took forever to come out. The servers were very good but the food should not take this long on a Monday at 5:30. It was worth the wait though. We will return soon.",

I found the place quite decent without lineups for the Saturday brunch time.  The food was average and my eggs Benedict tasted like they had been sitting there all morning just waiting for me to show up, that or the A/C seriously cooled it down before it made it to my table.  The earthy Benedict was rather tasty (as there was bacon in it!) and in general I'd say the food presentation is decent as well. How was the service? Nice and slow... So you better get a good window seat to enjoy the view while waiting. I would say that it's better to go to the resto and get food and a complimentary view than just to go to the observation deck alone so I would say it's definitely worth a visit.",

The sandwich is garnished with cucumber, lettuce, and isn't over saturated with seasoning/sauces. For add-ins, the wasabi honey is my favorite. It's just a hint of heat and sweetness, although the sandwich is good alone. Also, I am a fan of their fries and coleslaw. The fries are thin, shoe-string type and they are crispy on the outside and mashed potato-y on the inside, and not so greasy. I am usually not a fan of coleslaw mostly because I do not like mayo, but this coleslaw was pretty good! It is vinegary and not very creamy at all, which might not appeal to some people but was good for me. They also have their own recipe sodas and sweet and ice tea. The root beer is bomb.",

    "text": "I'm giving this 4 stars, but I believe this will become a 5 star review and quite possilby the best restaurant in Madison in due time. \n\nI went after it was open for only 4 days, and my meal was excellent but not quite perfect. I am pretty picky at expensive restaurants, and none of the minor flaws were things that would prevent me from returning. I had the hamachi crudo with crispy potatoes -- if each bite had a little of every garnish (especially the tiny lightly spicy pepper) it was delicate and delicious. But if the bite missed any of the many small elements on the dish, then it lacked seasoning. I also had manila clams which were delicious, light with a wonderful broth -- but there was a little grit in the broth. And I also had a half order of agnolotti with a pea sauce with shaved truffles. The flavor was absolutely out of this world, but it arrived at the same time as the clams, and the truffle was too strong to eat alongside the light clams.The housemade pasta was a little TOO al dente for my taste, but I understand that many chefs believe in leaving a \"bite\" to noodles and risotto that isn't to my taste. I was concerned the pasta would get cold if I ate it last, but it was just fine. So, a small plate, an antipasti and a 1/2 primi plus a nice glass of white wine ran me $70 with tip. So not cheap -- but a very elegant room and a really interesting menu. I am eager to go back and try several other items on the menu",

You get a salad or soup with your meal. Prior to your meal they serve you hot ciabatta rolls with whipped butter. The caesar salad dressing is made perfect- with just the right anchovies. The prime rib is always tasty- perfectly cooked and seasoned well. They offer pure horseradish and less spicy horseradish sauce. On the side, you have a choice of potato or vegetables. The price of the meal between 3 of us was under $60 without tip. It's a great value. Keep in mind i've had prime rib at Lawry's and Prime Rib Loft is better.",

There are also some birds and snakes.  It is very interesting and there are nine different feeding stations.  We bought a season pass but if you want to feed, you have to buy feed tokens for extra. Still, it is pretty affordable.\n\nThe kinks - very little signage exists explaining the exhibits.  Several glass enclosures had no descriptions.  I really hoped it would include more information about the creatures.\n\nAlso, it is very difficult to see some of the creatures due to the opacity of the water, unless they swim right by.\n\nFinally, it has only been open just over a month but some of the exhibits are empty.\n\nI hope they fix these problems because this is a great experience for the kids and adults alike.",

Not great - just average (and a little pricey for average).\n\nI'm a huge fan of the two main Chase restaurants and return regularly. I had high expectations for Fin as I hoped it would serve as a new work lunch stop. Sadly... It disappoints.\n\nFirst I had the grilled Mahi Mahi sandwich. These trendy black buns appear to be all the rage in Japan but they are incredibly dry and tasteless. A McDonalds bun would be tastier.  The fish was good and fresh. That said, I prefer the grilled Mahi Mahi at Buster's Sea Cove in the Market. Equally fresh but a bigger portion and a few bucks cheaper. \n\nI also tried the Seared Tuna - same story as the Mahi Mahi. Salads are not bad but are served with too much dressing. I recommend asking for it on the side. \n\nPortions are on the small side and your fish, side and a drink will cost $20. \n\nService was good but the lunch crowd was light on both my visits. Your food is ready in about 5-7 minutes. They have a number of bar tables to eat on but not a chair / bar stool in sight. And the heat is blasting. Not very enjoyable to eat in the restaurant. \n\nNo real reason to make this a destination for lunch / dinner. I will stick with the main two restaurants. Not sure Fin will have long term success. I'm sure I represent their exact target market but they missed the mark in my opinion.\n\nBK",

I made the mistake of sharing. I would've devoured one... or two by myself. Steak and eggs, yes. Perfectly charred and seasoned on the outside but medium rare goodness on the inside. Tender, juicy, and flavorful. The chicken and waffles was okay. Big enough to split between two. Forgot what the name of the vegetarian everything bagel sandwich was, but it was good. The loco moco with spam... so delicious and big enough to split. \n\nService was exceptional. Special thanks to our server, Maria. She took good care of us. Thank you! We will definitely be back when we're in the area.",

It's been on my to do list for a while. \n\nLuckily when we got there we had just missed the \"Obama Rush\". We were seated right away. \n\nOrdered:\nVica - Wood Oven Sausage, Sauteed Fennel, Red Onions, Mascarpone, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil \nDiavola - Crushed Tomatoes, Finnochiona (Peppered Salame), Roasted Red Bell Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Garlic, Mozzarella, Extra Virgin Olive Oil \n\nThe server was cool and pointed out that we had just ordered 2 white pizzas. He suggested we could ad tomato sauce to the Diaviola which ended up being pretty tasty. \n\nThen we couldn't resist and ended up ordering 3 desserts. \n\nThey have 12 pizzas to choose from, all looked pretty damn good. I am also a huge fan of the thin crust. \n\nNot a huge selection of wine's but it was just enough for a class pizza joint.",

    "text": "I have two words for you: pi-zookie\n\nIn certain situations there is nothing you crave more than a good BJs. Another review compared it to Chilis and that comparison is probably pretty apt but I think of it more as a cheese cake factory- they don't really specialize in anything (food wise)-they have an enormous menu with a bunch of diverse options, none of which knock your socks off but all of which are passable.BJs is a great compromise spot when trying to negotiate a meal with a large group- it has something for everyone .\n\n\nAll that being said we all know what we really love about BJs- the pizookie. If it wasn't for this dessert no one would have heard of this restaurant/it would of gone the way of the dodo. The pizookie is a skillet cookie Sunday that you can get in a bunch of different flavors- both cookie and ice cream. They even have a sampler pizookie that comes with 3 different cookie and ice cream combinations so you can get a variety. However, for the discerning foodie the only real option is the white chocolate macadamia nut one- the cookie comes not quite baked through, very soft and gooey in the middle. This means the white chocolate will be basically molten (be careful you don't burn 1/2 your face off Harvey Dent style by shoveling it in too fast... I know from experience) and though the whole cookie itself is soft the nuts will give you that crunch for textural contrast that is so key. \n\nIn closing- PI ZOOKIE MOFO",

    "text": "I've often found fault with myself in raising expectations of restaurants that get mostly 5 star reviews pre-visit.   It's so difficult for any experience to match the one I can create in my head while reading everyone eloquently explaining the meaning of life found in a piece of beef tongue.  Oddly enough I had the opposite experience with Yuzu.   Despite it's high marks thus far on here, the reviewers that I know and love (okay, I'm talking Elite here) for the most part gave it a measly 4 stars.   Bah, why even bother?   It's a sad state of affairs when even a 4 star review isn't enough to get my juices flowing.   Well here it was, 9pm on a Friday night and wanting something quick and close to the house to grab a bite.  \n\nFrom the moment I walked in the door I had roughly 10 \"wow\" moments.  From the way they transformed what used to be a sandwich shop into a cute and quaint Japanese spot to every single dish, my mild expectations were pleasantly blown out of the water every few minutes.\n\nI started with a simple salad.  The kind waitress was eager to explain all dishes which arrived and I found that to be a nice touch.   She explained that the dressing was homemade and made of Yuzu, which was apropos.   I know I've had yuzu dressing before and this one was tangier and tasted better than I'm used to which set it apart from the standard Japanese side salad I'm accustomed to.  Next was the Miso soup.  My version which was part of some sort of combo with one of our entrees (add $3 to any entree gets you salad, soup, and rice) did not come with Tofu, but my friend that accompanied me ordered one a la carte which comes with tofu.   Ironically enough she hates tofu and I love it, so we switched.  The tofu was fantastic, which I might be wrong in assuming is their handmade Zaru tofu.  If it was not homemade, it definitely fooled me.  At this point in most Japanese restaurants I've eaten the salad and miso soup just because they're there, but here at Yuzu they felt like important components to the meal.   \n\nNext our entrees started arriving, and first was the Kobe Beef Aburi.  Perfectly seared and with these little garlic chips which complemented it wonderfully.  I also received my side of rice around this time and I know you'll just think I'm pulling your leg at this point, but even the rice seemed a step above.  To make sure I hadn't accidentally ingested something laced with pot on the drive over, I had my friend try it and she confirmed that it did taste better than \"just rice\".   This is a master at work in the kitchen.\n\nNext up was one of our standard orders of Yellowtail jalapeno.  The fish melted in my mouth and the flavor was spectacular.  I did think that the jalapenos were a little too small and didn't provide the kick that I normally like, but it was still delectable.  Our last entree was the Salmon Foil Broil, which is boiled with several veggies.   Good god was this delicious.  The salmon just fell apart and had a great flavor especially when combined with the veggies it'd been broiled with.   \"Wow\" was muttered for approximately the 8th time.   \n\nI decided I had to have the yuzu sorbet because at this point I was convinced everything was going to taste munchies-esque good.   I was right!   Being lactose intolerant I cannot resist sorbet, and the yuzu flavor was perfect.   The waitress also brought out a complimentary order of their soy milk pudding.  I'm not a huge fan of soy milk, but this one was light enough in the soy flavor and  topped with whipped cream which always helps.   I enjoyed it even though I had to pop a lactaid pill to do so.   \n\nThe final wow was brought on by the arrival of the bill.   All those fantastic dishes came out to a total of $48 or so after tax.   I even had to do the obligatory \"on the strip that would have cost $100 and been worth every penny\" comment.",

    "text": "If I could give Steve 10 stars, I would. I called him at 11pm to schedule a 4:30am pickup the next morning. Though it was really a last minute thing, Steve was polite and professional and said he was available, took down my number and said he'd be there at 4:30. Now, I've taken enough taxis in Chicago to know that often, especially with big taxi companies, taxis aren't there to pick you up when they say they will. I wasn't sure - would he show up on time? Would he show up at all? 4:30 is pretty early in the morning. If he didn't show, or was late, I was going to miss my shuttle up to Midway and it was for work - I couldn't miss my flight. \n\nWell, I didn't have to worry. Not only did Steve show up, he was early (didn't charge me for that, of course). His taxi was incredibly clean and fresher than probably any car I've been in, including my own. Steve himself was personable as well as professional. He was also very knowledgeable about the area and knew exactly where my shuttle would arrive at the station. \n\nBut here's what impressed me the most. We got to the shuttle stop and the shuttle hadn't arrived yet, so he stayed with me to make sure I got on the shuttle safely, at no charge for his time. He explained he wouldn't feel right dropping someone off in the dark without knowing they got to their destination or next transfer safely. Then, it turned out my shuttle was full! I asked him if he went all the way to Midway. He said yes, but that honestly to go that distance, there were some cheaper options. He actually even brainstormed with me about other options in the area! He stayed there to make sure I wouldn't be stranded, as I tried to figure out if any of those other options would work. When it turned out they wouldn't, he offer to lower his rate so that I could have one more option - it was still more expensive than Uber would have been (slightly - maybe about a total $30 difference), but I was glad to do it as by then I knew I trusted him as an individual. As a woman going all the way to Midway by myself that early in the morning, I didn't want to take my chances with some random Uber driver who might not be a safe driver or a safe person. It was a great ride there - good conversation (he's a super interesting guy and easy to talk to without being in-your-face chatty) and he's a safe driver (unlike the last Uber I took when I was traveling, that tailgated and zoomed in and out of lanes so quickly that I was sick the whole day after).  \n\nTL;DR: Definitely go with Steve of Executive Taxi if you want to ride in a clean vehicle, with a professional, caring, conscientious driver. I was so impressed by his honesty and integrity, generosity, and caring. He is also just a really cool person to talk to if you are going on a long ride. Also, I found out talking to Steve that he basically IS Executive Taxi, so if you call you're going to get only him or, if he has an emergency and can't make it, one of two other trusted affiliates. He doesn't farm out to dozens of other taxi services, thankfully.\n\nI'll always be thankful I went with Executive Taxi for my 4:30am travel fiasco, because he turned it into such a positive experience. Thanks again Steve for saving the day for me!",

Proximity is important. \n2) They have an extensive outdoor seating area so on nice evenings it is perfect. They also have some yard games. \n3) It's just a very laid back environment. The bar staff is helpful and friendly. You can bring food with you and no one is going to make a stink about it (a friend and I showed up with a pizza, not a word). \n4) To reiterate the prices you can't beat. \n5) ANNND the variety is insane. For beer they have a room temp area to choose from, and you can throw it in their chiller. Or they have a fridge of already chilled beer (smaller selection), as well as several options on tap. Then, if you're more of a wine enthusiast, they have a decent selection of wine as well. \n\nEverybody wins. Go here and you won't regret it.",

I would expect such junk as DRY stir-fry noodles over at the Excalibur buffet for $15, but for the $25 Sunday Brunch? At one of the most expensive hotels on the strip? Gross!\n\nI suggest skipping the Bellagio buffet all together and heading over to the Wynn - a better buffet splurge (even though it's $5 or so cheaper). See my review for more info.\n\nLooking forward to maybe plunking down the $85 for the Bally's Silver Buffet or whatever it's called on my next trip!",

Atmosphere is good.  Kid friendly place. Nothing intimidating here, everyone gives each other space and respects others. \nFrom looking at the photos from other reviewers, it looks like they change the climbing rock formations once in awhile, to keep it interesting and challenging. Great idea!!!\nVery happy with first visit, and happy that its kid friendly. Prepare to spend a few hours here.\n\nRecommended :)",

The consistency of fresh sashimi should be firm but not spongy. Fresh salmon, should glisten more. As a rule, the duller the color, the more spongy consistency; the lower the quality. Cleveland suffers from being far from the ocean. Sushi suffers a bit especially in the winter months.\n\nWith all that criteria laid out, and having had sushi in Asia as a frame of reference; Pacific East and Shuhei; have the freshest sashimi-grade fish one can find in Cleveland. I order sashimi in places like this. In lesser places I go for rolls and drown it in the sauces to compensate - not here. Sushi rock is good too -- but the quality is the same as Pacific East but at a much higher price. All the good places use authentic short-grain Japanese rice -- watch out for places that try to pull a fast one with substitutes to this kind of rice.\n\nOne of my favorite non-sushi dishes is Unagi Don and Shrimp tempura.\n\nSushi here can't ever be as good as sushi in coastal areas and in Asia, but I'm giving it 4 stars because, all things considered, this is the best in Cleveland.\n\n...as for Malaysian food in a Japanese restaurant, sigh, why? OK, nothing wrong with that, but I have a thing about restaurant \"purity of theme\".",

So we called and the girl on the other line told me she had no record of my daughter and proceeded to hang up. When we got home 2 hrs later received two calls from the office to apologize that there was a communication problem that their dentist was not coming in so the office was closed. Never received a call regarding the closure. To add insult to injury the girl who hung up on me called to say she was sorry. Never going back. This is the second time has happened.",

So when she came back and asked how the drink was I told her it was good but a bit strong. She made a joke about her drinks being too strong, then brought me the remaining (almost full) can of ginger beer so I could dilute it, which was quite nice.\nAs soon as lent is over, I'm going back!",

I've actually recommended them to several people and they've had the same experience it seems like to me that the people on here aren't saying who they need to see or having problems with their records because they aren't clarifying what they need. I have never had an issue even in the records department they have kept up with info to my disability department and provided whatever records I needed on time and been as diligent as possible  helping me to receive benefits as they possibly could be.

    "text": "Looking around Yelp for something special in the area while traveling and my family and I enjoyed the photos and reviews for this spot, so we stopped in for dinner. Not sure why, but we had an awful experiance. Was extremely disappointed with the staff, quality of the food and experience overall.\n\nFamily of six and no one enjoyed their meal and said we should have gone to Del Taco after eating here. \n\nI ordered the ribeye tacos and they looked good, but the meat tasted awful, was super thin and cut up into very small chunks with a bad taste to it and even the tortilla tasted bad.  The fresh avocado was a nice touch, but this dish was a total fail!\n\nMy wife went with a mix of tacos. She said the barbacoa was very oily and could have used salt, chicken was very peppery and tasted like it came out of a bag and like be hated the ribeye.\n\nThe kids meals that come with a drink and side which is cool. We got quesadillas and unfortunately they were not good. The kids did not eat them and said they tasted bad. Sampling them to see what was up, my wife and I both agreed they were super super salty. $7 x 2 fail on the kids meals.\n\nMy son got $10 nachos with no sour cream.  Then when it came it had no beans and sour cream and when I told them that this was not what context (very politely) they argued with me and said I never said no sour cream and I said no beans. My son and I both were pretty clear at the register no sour and perhaps they heard no beans. The nachos were awful! The cheese wiz with peppery chicken that tasted like it was pulled out of a bag. The chips were very greasy and really did not work for nachos. This was an epic fail and I am very surprised this place has such good reviews considering everything we had was bad.",

Called back and same thing (yes, checked the phone number, etc.  This is the THIRD time we have had problems at this KFC. Sadly, it seems as if this store is poorly managed and the help they hire isn't worth the minimum wage they are probably being paid. They are surly, rude, and dumb as sticks on top of it all. Avoid this KFC like the plague if you want my advice. There are newer and far cleaner stores in Mesa and Tempe and Gilbert that actually have well trained and polite and helpful staff. Too bad this isn't one of them! Who ever owns/manages this mess of a store ought to be ashamed of the lousy service, rude help and fairly dirty store! Do not go here even if you're starving!",

Once at your table, the menu itself is very simple and everything tastes great. The restaurant itself is quite noisy and during the summer, the shutters at the front are open which gives the place a nice airy ambiance.\n\nThe Khao Soi (see above) is excellent and can be ordered to your preferred spice level. We also tried the squash fritters which were very tasty.\n\nThe bill was about $40 for two mains and a shared starter which is expensive enough, but it's worth it.\n\nA must try if you are in the Theatre District for a show or going to see a movie at Scotiabank Theatre!",

I was so disappointed when I heard about the health code issues at the Henderson location, so I was happy to see that this location was good to go. \n\nWe ordered a plethora of dishes, all of which were very delicious! However, they are so overpriced that it was hard to make sure the small party I was with got even a taste of each dish. Some of the small dishes had only 2 pieces! For $10-ish dollars, I think that's a bit ridiculous. I simply couldn't afford to eat here with more than one or two people, because that adds up quickly. \n\nI love the interior of this restaurant. It is a pleasant place to be! I especially love the patio, although it was closed the last time I was there. \n\nOverall, this would be a good restaurant for a date, but, in my and my wallets opinion, not so great for a party of multiple people because you would need multiple plates of the same item. The bacon covered dates and sangria are must haves.",

Maybe I'm picky but, in the past, there was pretty much only one person who was able to cut my hair the way I liked. Unfortunately the place became so busy that it was too difficult to get appointments and I ended up moving away as well.\n\nTherefore the search for a good, relatively reasonably priced hair stylist began, and Toronto (the city I'm from) generally came up short.\n\nI was in Cleveland for a bit on business and was in desperate need of a haircut. I decided to bite the bullet and get one before I got back to Toronto to see if I could get some luck in Cleveland. It turned out to be a great decision as it is one of the best cuts I have received so far.\n\nI was lucky to get a same day appointment with Melissa, presumably since she had  cancellation. I would greatly recommend her for men with thick hair or asian type hair as she really knows what she is doing. I was able to tell her the general idea of what I wanted and got good input on styling recommendations.\n\nOverall the haircut was above my expectations. Melissa did a great job and gave me exactly what I requested. For full disclosure, upon coming home I can see a couple of spots where it could have been improved but on an overall basis, I am really happy because it is clear that this cut will be able to keep its shape as it grows. Another plus: she even washed my hair after the cut saving me a shower when I got home.\n\nIf a $25-30 cut is within your budget I would strongly recommend going to Eddy's on Coventry and I would personally recommend Melissa",

I get home excited to try something new.  The slider is dripping grease (so much for gourmet) overly covered in some orangish sauce that tastes like Thousand Island minus the relish, the meat patty is half burned.  At least the sandwich was still warm.\n\nNow for the fries, feta and balsamic on fries sounded like an appetizer from a super fancy restaurant.  I'd love to say they were amazing and made up for the crummy $3 slider, but when I opened my fries they were covered in the same disgusting sauce as the slider, bland caramelized onions (how these had no flavor I'm not sure), plastic cheddar cheese that had congealed beyond edible (how the cheese could be hardened and the fries still relatively hot is beyond me) and bacon.  \n\nSo sorry Slidin' Thru, no home run for you, you struck out on the first try.\n\nNo way will I try this again when a crappy meal cost over $7.",

    "text": "The food here is great! And, the customer service is top-notch. I say this, even after we had a misunderstanding with the restaurant and the front counter of the Orleans. But.... it really wasn't the restaurant's fault. Allow me to explain, we were given a food comp from The Orleans for $50. This was part of the hotel package that we received. We had put down a cash deposit for our stay... we did not use a credit card for this trip. Well, when we tried to use our food credit at the restaurant, the restaurant initially tried to charge it to the room.  After we had already departed from the restaurant, the restaurant realized that because there was no credit card on file, they could not charge it to the room so they called the front desk. An employee at the front desk who really did not know her job too well, told them that they had to figure it out so the employee of the restaurant actually called the hotel room, at 2 a.m! So both employees at this point had made mistakes, but the mistakes were each based on the fact that there are not proper procedures in place for when a guest checks in with cash as a deposit, and is receiving a comp. Eventually, after my wife spoke to a more well-versed employee at the front counter the entire situation was figured out. The restaurant, apologized for the employee calling the room at such a late hour, the restaurant offered us a free dinner for the misunderstanding, and the server actually came to our table personally, and apologized profusely.  The manager on duty was very polite and very accommodating to us. And we were very thankful to him. The Orleans needs to figure out how to set the system in place to something like this does not continue to happen because from what we were told it happens all the time!",

Between this and the new Bell's bbq up the street, this is some of the worst bbq I have ever experienced. Are the LVite's so deprived & ignorant to what great barbecue it that they feel this is good? It seems to me that before people open a restaurant it would be something they are good/great at making, and comfortable maintaining the quality for large numbers of people. These places need better brining & curing processes for taste & moisture, smoke quality & control, and knowing when to stop cooking! This is not food that is cooked to order folks, the expertise, control and cooking is supposed to be done ahead of time and reheated gently for your dining pleasure, or not. Dry, overcooked and tasteless should not be part of the process, not when your taking our hard earned dollars.",

We got what Emily said and were not disappointed in the slightest.  Yummy shrimp appetizer with which we dipped cheese bread in the garlic sauce. Seafood stew was stupendous. The drinks are memorable- fresh and exciting. Passion fruit dessert was also memorable. We can not wait to come back and try what the table next to us ordered- none of which is the same as we got but all looks great. Casual, fun, and a place we will come back to in a second.",

    "text": "The Greenbush Bar doesn't need a good review, or a bad one.  When you walk in, you immediately understand that this is a one of a kind space by Madison standards.  There's a sensibility to the entire place that makes you intuitively understand that you're in the right place at the right time.  Seeing the owner bussing tables and getting her hands dirty, seeing waitstaff doing their best to assist patrons and refill water glasses.  These are good signs.  The beer, wine and liquor menu covered a lot of ground, and had something for anyone.  Starters included a roasted garlic app, which had good flavor, and was a nice compliment to their in-house bread.  Another good choice was the tossed green salad, which included reggiano-parm cheese, olives and cucumber slices.  Finally, a reliable pizza topped with sausage and green peppers.  Incidentally, they give you a choice of crust thickness, and even have a gluten free crust option.  The only disappointment was a corn and leek soup, which was too brothy and had no spice profile (as in NONE).  In spite of that, I'll be back.",

Let me just clarify that this is a top notch fine seafood cuisine, so bare this in mind before expecting a cheap meal.\n\nThe decor is absolutely gorgeous, you first walk in and you're greeted by a front receptionist. Just beside the entrance they have a massive aquarium where they hold some of the largest lobsters, crabs and fishes you have ever seen.\nThe bathroom is a single luxury suite equipped with mouth wash, q tips.. Etc.\n\nService is beyond superb, as waiters and waitresses are very friendly and attentive to your every need. They also help you separate your meal into plates and bowls for every guests. They are very efficient in cleaning our plates right when it gets full.\n\nWe had breakfast and dinner here the same day, so the prices differ extremely between the two.\n\nBreakfast is dim sum style, we had a table of 8, and ate roughly $300 with a bag of leftovers.\n\nThe dinner comes in sets of meal that matches up with suggested serving sizes from 2 up to 12 people. The prices start at around $300 and up to $1700.\nWe had a set of lobster and crab meal, for 8 people, the set itself was around $800. We ordered other dishes and wine, the bill came up to be about $900. The meal was very filling and there were still lots of left overs, we ended up packing up 2 bags. \n\nTo be honest we could probably pull off a 6 people meal set as they give a lot. \n\nI didn't take pics of every dishes but in our set we had, \nSashimi platter \nClams \nSea cucumber \n12lb lobster \n2 crabs\nFish \nRice\nSoup \nDesert drink \nFruit platter",

Weekend dinner comes to about $18.99. \n\n- Meats: There are some average to decent cuts of meat. The most memorable was the Chako Ribs (which is only available for dinner). thicker and marinated. Delicious!\n\n- Vegetables: There's pineapples! And also zuchhini and red peppers. But pineapples! Who wouldn't be excited?\n\n- Sushi: There are 4 choices of sushi. Average, but at least you do have the option to order it at a KBBQ.\n\n- Seafood:  Calamari, tiliapia, shrimp and mussels.\n\n- Side dishes: As mentioned, the kim chi is surprisingly tasty. You're also offered tofu, bean sprouts, seaweed.\n\nOf course, order the rice. I don't know how anyone can go through all that sodium/fat without blending that taste.\n\nChako is a good choice for group outings, though it can get quite packed during Friday and Saturday nights. Service start to be much slower and inconsistent: multiple attempts to re-order dishes that never showed up, or to change the BBQ plate, or to clear some of the dishes away. So it can get quite frustrating.",

    "text": "The hype is not real with this one.\n\nI don't get this place. Given how they advertise themselves on IG, I came in here thinking this was more of a bakery with a few drinks here and there. But nope, it's apparently the other way around. Cafe 86 is more of a boba/coffee shop with a few pastries. I don't know about you guys, but I came here to try their pastries.. and 2 out of the 3 times I have gone there, they barely had anything left. If you're going to heavily advertise your pastries everywhere on social media, maybe you should focus on having them readily available.\n\nFirst visit, they had no pastries available.. and we came around 3pm. Since we were already there, we decided to go ahead and try a drink. I asked the cashier what she recommended, and she said that the Ube Monster was popular - so thats what I ordered. I guess it's supposed to be like a Ube and Cookies&Cream milkshake. I hated it. It had very little Ube flavor and just tasted like milk. The cookies weren't even throughout the whole drink. All they did was put some cookies at the bottom of the cup, and on top. Pretty lame. Super disappointing and do not recommend. \n\n2nd visit, they had only ube truffles available.. and we came around 5pm. We also did the Yelp check-in for a free Hibiscus Cooler. The ube truffle had good ube flavor, but the texture wasn't to my liking. My toddler ended up eating it all though. The Hibiscus Cooler was pretty terrible - it literally tasted like water. Another disappointing visit.\n\n3rd and final visit, we came in around 11am and was finally able to try the Ube Leche Flan Cupcakes. We also ordered the Mermaid Drink with Boba (Sea Salt Green Tea), an Ube Truffle, and got the free Hibiscus Cooler again (hoping it wouldn't be watery like last time). Was super excited to try the cupcakes, since that was what this place is known for.. but was pretty let down. The cupcake was hard and dense! I felt like I was eating play-doh or something. I'm sorry, but that's not how a cupcake should be. The only saving grace was the flan, but even that was just okay. We ended up just eating the flan and tossing the \"cupcakes\" away. Both drinks we got tasted watered down yet again, and the boba had no flavor. Yet another disappointing visit.\n\nAlso, what is up with the the theme of this place? It's all over the place. It's like they just took everything they like and threw it all together, even though it makes no sense at all. Star Wars, cars, Filipino sun, mermaid drink, _____ monster drinks, zebra drink? It doesn't make sense.\n\nCafe 86 is just all hype. It's sad, because I love me some good pastries. Such a shame!\n\nTL;DR - They seldom have the pastries available that they widely advertise. Pastries are not as great as everyone makes it seem, and the drinks are just bad. \n\nTip: If you want their pastries, go right when they open. If you want drinks, go to Brew Tea Bar.",

    "text": "Good food; Bad Flies; So-So Service.\n\nTried this place with my family after the June 2012 write-up in Phoenix Magazine.  The restaurant was a little odd to find and the mandatory valet was interesting, but the interior is amazing.  The person(s) who did the building and interior design did a superb job-- the spot is very open, the revealed kitchen is fun (especially for an interested 4 year-old), and the artistic touches and lighting fit perfectly.  Not often I take notice of these kinds of things, but this is an exceptional concept place that way.\n\nWe tried the Chef's Board, Burrata Alla Panna (asparagus), Mafaldine (rock shrimp and long noodles), Margherita pizza, and buttered noodles. All were very good, though not remarkable.  Bread is for-charge and the water has an \"interesting\" taste.\n\nThe most offending thing was the flies.  We're talking lots of them.  And big ones.  And so persistent you might as well pull them up a chair and plate.  \n\nWhen your little kid asks why there are so many flies an why they have red stripes and such big eyes, something went awry.  A kid should not notice the exoskeletonal features of insects at a nice restaurant.  Odd to constantly brush the flies away, just look around to see every other table doing the same.  It proved to b a sad, asynchronous dance for would-be happy diners.  We skipped dessert just to get away from the bothersome diptera.  If only the service staff was as attentive!\n\nWaitress was middling at best.  Drinks were left unfilled for long periods.  Two plates came out too hot while the pizza was just warm-- our daughter's dish came out so hot that she would have burnt her mouth had my wife not tested first (and singed her tongue).  I also had to ask if there were specials because it wasn't volunteered... Maybe specials are a private and fabulous secret, here.  I didn't order the special soup, so not sure if it was indeed nirvana.\n\nWould visit again if there was reason, but my wife and I agreed walking out that it wouldn't be worth a trip on its own.",

Moving is never fun but they certainly made it a lot less stressful. They took the time to explain all our options and were patient, never pushy, while we decided on the right-size storage for our needs. They even provided a move-in van free of charge saving us time and money! Desert Storage is the cleanest, most accessible storage facility (air-conditioned park-in loading bay) we've seen. Since we were storing some boxes and furniture during the Summer months we wanted a unit that was air conditioned, and after shopping around we found their prices very reasonable. I have to say it was a huge plus to be able to drive right into the air-conditioned bay and not have to unload in the heat. Also, with all of the security measures they have in place we have peace of mind knowing our possessions are safe and secure. Great experience all around.  5 stars without hesitation!",

    "text": "Terrible, just terrible!  What I found in this office was rampant irresponsibility, incompetence and lack of professionalism.  \n\nI've been doing my own taxes with TT for the last 5 years.  After learning that H&R offers a second look tax review from your taxes filed the previous year, I decided to put them to the test to review my 2015 tax filing. Based on my experience, I would entrust them with my new tax filing for year 2016 since now I don't have the time to work on that.  Boy, did they fail the test.\n\nIn October 2016 I dropped off two binders corresponding to my taxes filed in 2014 and 2015.  They were supposed to check 2015 only, but the tax consultant asked me to leave also 2014 in case she needed to reference to that year to clarify something.  After two months of not hearing anything from her, I sent her an email and she informed me that she had been transferred to another office and my binders had been assigned to another agent.  The new agent never contacted me, never did anything on my taxes and when I stopped by H&R she did not know where the binders were. After some looking around, she found them.  I reported that to my original agent and she contacted the office manager about my problem.\n\nI went online and, after reading the profiles of the agents in that office, I chose one with vast real estate experience since I own rental properties.  Subsequently, the office manager, without my consent or authorization, removed her name and re-assigned me to Claudia Melissa Argueta, now Claudia Melissa Bozic.  Being that it was a referral from the manager and she was aware of what I needed, I trusted her judgment and went along with her choice.  BAD CHOICE!\n\nClaudia Melissa Bozic received my binders on December 2 and by the end of February 2017 she had not done the review.\n\nOn January 11, 2017, I sent her a follow up email to see how things were going with the tax review. She did not respond to my email.   Afraid that she had left the office, like the first tax consultant did, I personally went to H&R. She was there, we spoke briefly and she said that she was working on the tax review.\n\nNot having heard anything from her, I was very disappointed about the tremendous amount of time she was taking to do a review.  I am not a tax person and I can do my taxes in a week.  On February 21, 2017, I wrote her an emailed  expressing my disappointment and requesting the return of my binders.  \n\nThe email was undeliverable.  Claudia Melissa Bozic had changed her email address and didn't have the courtesy of notifying me. She was the one who said when I met her that she preferred communication via email.\n\nI needed my binders urgently since I was in the process of refinancing one of my properties and the bank needed my tax documents.  I called H&R and Claudia Melissa Bozic was in California and no one could find my binders in the office.\n\nI requested to speak with the office manager and they finally found my binders after much inconvenience caused to me.\n\nIn summary, since October 2016 to February 2017, this office did NOTHING.  Just wasted my time and caused aggravation that I didn't need.  It's a free service, ok, but if they are not going to do the job, please do not offer the service and disrespect people's time.\n\nDue to my bad experience, I do not recommend H&R Block.",

Marinara sauce straight from the can with no additions, tasted like watery flavorless acidy tomatoes. Pizza was undercooked and had to request them to cook it for another 20 minutes. Who wants droopy pizza that cannot stand up by itself....really? The baked rigatoni was the star of the show earning 3 stars out of 5 for being the least messed up, and having some good flavors. Will not be returning here again, unless I hear things have changed for the better. You could tell that there were no owners or mangers present. It was a millennial duo cook-off - the only thing missing was the microwave and the frozen burritos. Sorry guys you are going to have to try WAY harder than this; as the only one's that you are fooling are the one's with $8 bucks left in their pockets for dinner.",

    "text": "I have now visited La Mestiza twice, and I can't say enough good things about this place. We've struggled to find good Mexican food in Madison. La Mestiza will not satisfy your need for a giant burrito or tacos - it's not the traditional Mexican restaurant you find in America with combination plates. La Mestiza serves a relatively small menu composed of dishes highlighting the traditional regional cuisines of Mexico. \n\nThe dishes are a little bit pricey, but you get everything you expect in a pricey meal. The presentation is gorgeous, and the food is fresh and delicious. I personally recommend the enchiladas pollo con mole - their traditonal Oaxacan mole sauce is phenomenal, with all the subtle nuttiness and rich chocolate flavors I pray for when I order mole. We've ordered specials as well as the carne asada, and they all elicited \"ooo\"s and \"aahhh\"s. They have an excellent house margarita and a couple of Mexican draft beers.\n\nThe restaurant is very small, but cozy and pleasant. This is a casual restaurant that attracts a wide variety of people. The decor is inviting and comfortable, with interesting artwork hanging on the walls and paper cut-outs strung from the ceiling in a playful, un-tacky sort of way. Do come here to eat at a table - the bar only has a couple of chairs and seems to be intended only for people who are waiting for their take-out orders.\n\nFinally, the service is excellent. I've had two different servers (who were both there both times I've visited), and they offer the knowledgeable, understated, and appropriately attentive service I would expect from a fine dining restaurant.",

They are not good at dealing with food allergies either. The final straw was when my child came home with bruises on her neck and told me that the bully had choked her!!

If I lived in the neighborhood I'd eat at the Weary regularly with friends.  It seems like a great place to meet new people, given the warm woodsy layout and the low-tech emphasis (board games). In addition to the neighborhood vibe, the food was homey too. My $15 pork loin special with celery root side was delicious.  My dining partner happily consumed the Bad Breath Burger.  I had one of the many tasty beers on the menu - in fact you could make a game of trying all the beers.  This seems like a cozy place to settle in on a cold Wisconsin night.

I was asked about my insurance before my question of whether or not they are accepting new patients was even answered.  I was told November is the earliest new patient appointment and when I said I would like to move forward, the female I was speaking with, I think she said her name was Mary but she said it so quickly I can't be certain, placed me on hold.  After 5 and a half minutes,I hung up.  Poor potential patient experience!  I am calling for help, not to have my time wasted.  As an individual who works 60 hours a week, I don't have time to sit on hold, especially when you are only taking appointment calls between 8:30am and 4:30pm.  If she had come back on the line to provide an update, it may have evoked a better response but when you are forced to call for an appointment and cannot make an appointment online, the staff needs to be more on top of their game.",

They weren't pushy, I haven't found any hidden issues with the vehicle, and I was able to get a two year warranty. They actually Called me after the purchase and lowered my interest rate, offering more than one option through several lenders. As it relates to the previous reviews in relation to being unable to be approved for credit, this isn't a company issue, rather an issue a consumer should be aware they may experience based off their debt to income ratio. One thing I will say after purchasing the truck  is that it had 3 different types of  tires on it, so I was required to purchase a matching set. I will take fault for this though due to my failure to inspect the vehicle thoroughly, and I did purchase the vehicle at night.

Both were tasty though the Singapore Greens need a protein to round out the flavor profile, IMO. \n\nThe Hodgepodge consisted of pomme frites, tempura sweet potato,\ntruffle tots, & onion rings.  I liked the truffle tots, but a little overboard on the truffle oil & salt.  The presentation is a twisted & tiered tower; I posted a picture\n\nThe Diablo Egss are deviled eggs (obviously), pretty regular, a little on the salty side; there is a recurring theme, appearing here.\n\nThe elote was grilled corn in garlic butter with cayenne & topped with cilantro pesto.  I didn't try, sorry.\n\nFinally the Smokey Poke; little ahi tuna blocks in citrus ponzu, garnished with norichips & some type of fried squash or potato slices.  Great presentation & flavor, but SALTY...\n\nOk, I broke down our food, now for service.  It was feast or famine: repeat visits in a short period of time or no one for many tens of minutes.  They were trying hard, I could tell, but they didn't appear to have any type of \"table visit rotation\" procedure. The waitstaff was friendly, regardless.\n\nFinally, ambiance.  There were cute touches, like the sign for the bathrooms was a street sign called \"Flushing Avenue\", clever.  Decorations were sparse and the feel, to me, was that of a hipster automat.  I didn't mind it, but it also doesn't stand out.\n\nI am hoping that all these issues are due to its relative age.  I will definitely try here again though it is FAR from my regular stomping grounds.  Great ideas & concepts, but spotty execution is my overall impression.  Oh, yeah, and salt.",

    "text": "The pictures, the reviews... none of them do The Spa at Mandarin Oriental justice.  This is one of those \"you have to experience it for yourself\" type of places.  Five stars doesn't even scratch the surface of what type of service and accommodations you will receive when you spend your day here.  My mom and I decided to spend a full day and sample as much as we could possibly fit in... with some downtime in between services.  Booking appointments with the concierge - wonderful, informative, and top notch.  Arrive and check-in - fabulous.  This is the only spa I have been to where they have you complete a full health intake form - VERY MUCH appreciated.  All while you enjoy delicious hot tea, a cool cloth, and the removal of your shoes to be replaced with spa sandals.  The spa attendants were WONDERFUL and incredibly attentive.  Fresh tea, cold water, explanations of the facility... very thorough.\n\nMom and I started with the day with a Hammam treatment.  What a delight for the senses.  Firm, soft, hot, cold, warm... One of the most incredible treatments I have ever experienced.  I couldn't stop touching my legs for two days after - I was so silky, it was insane.  If you do ONE thing at The Spa - try the Hammam.  A total delight for the senses.\n\nThe Jade Enzyme facial was incredible and relaxing.  The Detox Foot Treatment was also incredible.  All of it.  Amazing.  I didn't even get to excessively use the facilities as I had originally intended... next time.  I spent most of my time relaxing on the warmed tiled loungers overlooking LV Boulevard or nestled up in the cozy beds in the relaxation room with a cup of hot tea and a bottle of ice water.\n\nNext time I go back, I will be booking the Time Ritual... two hours and fifty minutes of treatments customized specifically for my body's needs that day?  Oh heck yes!  Scrub me, rub me, make me melt!  I cannot wait to return!\n\nAs for the prices and the three lines of tips... get over it and show the people that make this place so wonderful a little respect... or don't come here for service.  These folks are working at one of the, if not THE best spa in Vegas and certainly command the prices that you will pay.  They are working very hard to make sure that you get your money's worth and I am a firm believer in gratuity that is commensurate with that effort.  So if you get a little sticker shock... head up strip to a different spa.  Tip rant off.\n\nAll in all and magical experience.  Worth every dollar and then some.  Looking forward to going back in a few months and trying a few different services.\n\nIf you don't want to valet, park in the Aria self-park and walk over to the Mandarin.  It is a surprisingly short and easy walk... when you arrive at the hotel, you take the elevator to the 23rd floor and then take the guest elevators down to the 8th floor.  It is a bit of an adventure, but plan for a little extra time just in case.  The hotel itself is also gorgeous and I hear that their high tea in their tea lounge is not to be missed.  Adding that to my 'next time' list!",

I'm not sure what has happened these past 2 years we've noticed that the quality and service have been going down hill. The food taste was off and the waitress weren't very nice. I'd get tired of waiting for a water refill and would go get it myself. As of yesterday they've reached a new low. Now, the place is just gross and disgusting. Never again will we go back. How they can prepare food that taste so bad and the waitress that has a \"you're annoying me\" attitude.... we're done.... it's sad because now we have to find a new place... Taco Bell has a better flavor than their cardboard chemical tasting attempt at mexican food. I'm really not a picky eater but all of us were feeling ill after the dinner.",

The earl grey truffle actually tasted like earl grey, and the lemon truffle was well-balanced.  They also had a nice consistency when I bit into them, neither too hard nor too soft.\n\nThis review is based only on their truffles, I have not tried any of their cakes or ice creams.  They also explained that they have a smaller variety of truffles in the summer due to weaker demand.",

Our waiter took the time to answer our questions about the different dishes and was very helpful.\n\nThe cocktails were $15 bucks each and about what you would expect. I had the kobe beef rolls which was average. I am not sure what the hype is about kobe beef and sushi, it was about 26 bucks for 5 pieces which is simply not worth it. I also had a rock shrimp tempura which was around 15 bucks and was excellent. \n\nIf staying at Planet Hollywood, I would give it a try, but otherwise your high end strip hotel will offer something comparable.",

    "text": "I was invited to Monkey Pants for a friends going away party. There was several of us there and I was definitely looking forward to having a good time since i'm a big fan of dive bars. I arrived and most everyone was already there enjoying their drinks. I waited about 15 minutes before I asked someone if we even had a waitress.... My buddy told me there was only 1 waitress/bartender working. After another 5 min I decided to just go to her at the bar. As I was getting up she was heading our way. She explained that this was her first day back from not bartending for a few years and she was the only one scheduled for another hour and a half. This made me change my game plane and I started ordering 2 beers so I wouldn't have to wait for a refill quickly. I gotta say for it just being her she hustled the best she could and I give her props, however, management should have known Friday nights gets busy and they should have at least had a waitress scheduled. It wasn't really right for the employee or the customer to have to deal with this. \n\nI ordered a burger with green chile and continued my 2 beer orders and that went rather well... The burger took a long time, im guessing a little over 30 minutes. I was a little frustrated with that but the burger was actually really good. I asked for some condiments and never got them, im sure it was because the waitress/bartender was slammed so I wasn't too worried about it. \n\nAfter awhile a waitress and another bartender showed up to take over and everything started running a lot more smoothly. Beers were flowing, shots were going down smooth, and we got our ordered items quickly. Around 8pm Karaoke started and it was on!!! I chose a couple songs and handed them to the DJ... I was told my songs weren't available.... I gave him a couple more and nope.... So if your planning to Karaoke make sure your gonna stick to the same ol same ol songs... Thunder Rolls, Baby got back, Grease, or a balls song. The DJ offered me to pay for songs I wanted to sing. I was going to tip him anyway so I paid the 2 dollars for 1 of my songs. Sang the song and dipped... Overall its a pretty chill bar, manager screwed the one waitress hopefully that doesn't become a pattern on Friday nights. Id roll thru again if my friends wanted to go there again.",

You want to talk about POOR service, its no wonder the USPS is loosing to UPS Stores and other mail places.\n\nIf we could have done what we needed done at the UPS store, we would have instead of coming here.  Let me expand.\n\nWe came in and of course there was a line with only 2 people behind the counter and one guy walking around trying to look busy..  We were there to do a door to door mailer which he even came over as soon as we came in and confirmed with us.  After about 5 minutes of standing in line, this guy came over and started pulling people with only one piece of business over to another counter.  \n\nAs he took some from the back of the line and some from in front of us, we eventually moved to be second in line.  The lady who was first had 5 packages to send out and said she was passed over 3 times.  She finally got called to the counter and we moved to be first in line, our time now nearing 30 minutes.  \n\nAfter standing there for another 5 minuites, this guy trying to look busy finally came over and told us to come to his counter.  Our transaction with him took less then 3 minutes.  \n\nSo, IF ANYONE AT THE USPS READS THIS....If you have a floater, they should take the next person in line and help them if they can, not pick and choose who you want to help and when you run out of options then help the person you have been skipping over and over and over....You want to know why you are loosing business, because of employees like this....",

After leaving thru their drive thru  I realized that they had already given me our drinks.. I called back after 5 minutes and told them that I was sorry that I drove away not realizing I already got the drinks and that I was just calling the bank to see why my card got declined. They said not to worry and they understand and I told them That I was on my way back. When I got to the window they said that because I was honest and called about the drinks that they would take care of the order and I didn't have to pay for it. My heart seriously melted ..not because of the money but because of the act of kindness from these 2 specific girls (I should have gotten their name.) it was seriously the nicest thing that has happened to me in a long time.

I very much appreciated his sincerity rather than simply saying, \"Oh, everything here is really great!\" I ended up getting the chicken sandwich. This was not the best chicken sandwich I've ever had but it was still very good, as it was flavorful and well-sized. The coleslaw was not good at all but thankfully that was just a tiny part of the meal. The fries were just fries: nothing to write home about but nothing wrong with them either.

It helped that our waitress was very nice and attentive.\n\nI definitely recommend it.",

It looks okay when you walk in, modern decor, clean setting. But both mine and my partners food were very, very unsatisfying. I ordered home fries, two eggs over-medium, whole wheat toast and coffee. The only thing cooked to order was the home fries- but the ketchup they gave us was over a year expired. Yuck? My eggs were heavily salt and peppered and over-hard, my toast wasn't even toasted. It was just slightly warm bread. And our coffees were a sickly sweet hazelnut, which neither of us had asked for. We both left disappointed and unsatisfied and walked to the Starbucks down the street to get \"better\" coffee. \nThe service was okay, though it was unclear if we pay at the register or the table, since our order was taken at the table but there was a sign saying you were supposed to order at the register. Confusing. I wouldn't recommend.",

I've been looking for a store in Las Vegas that features these items for so long!  Not only do they have an amazing selection but their prices, service and expertise were beyond impressive. \n\nIn addition to their geodes, they also have a great selection of Native American jewelry, artifacts, incense, and pottery.  I highly recommend this store!",

    "text": "If you're staying at the MGM Grand, I recommend trying Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill. I ate there for lunch and dinner and shared a total of 6 dishes. I suggest the Corned Beef Reuben with Sauerkraut and Swiss on Rye with Potato Salad for $15 if you want a good deli style sandwich. The Fish of the Day (Halibut) with Wild Mushrooms and Pearl Onions, Creamy Corn Puree and Tomato Fondue for $31 was also very good. For salads, I thought the Chopped Vegetable Salad with Feta Cheese, Garlic Croutons and Creamy Greek Dressing was very good and can easily be shared with people as an appetizer.\n\nThe portions vary between the dishes. I thought the Ricotta Gnocchi with Sweet Fennel-Sausage Bolognese for $23 was a little on the small side compared to the Sweet Pea and Goat Cheese Filled Tortellini with Wild Mushrooms and Parmesan Reggiano for $25. You also can't go wrong with the Grilled Prime Burger with Vermont Cheddar and Smoked Onion Marmalade for $18. \n\nThe Crab cakes were delicious, $17 for 4 crab cakes. When comparing Wolfgang Puck's prices to other MGM restaurants, this place is very reasonable and the servers provided excellent service both times I dined. Nice atmosphere too. I would go eat here again.",

    "text": "I feel the need to tell all my fellow Yelpers about the HORRIBLE service I received at Winners yesterday morning. Let's start at the beginning. \n\nI got there right at 9am, supposedly when they open, and I watched as the employees sat around on the counters and chatted in what seemed to be a staff meeting. It was freezing outside and considering it was 9am I was expecting the door to open any minute. \n\nI waited and I waited. I watched as one by one, the employees noticed me standing outside, and one by one, they peeked their heads around and just stared. You'd think someone would have come to my rescue, but nope. They just continued sitting around on the counters and occasionally looking back to see if I was still there. \n\nI finally got inside at 9:10am (which SUCKS because by this point, I'm late for work) and I told them I had to return an item. The assistant manager said \"Malcolm will help you on the other side\". So i walked around to the other side and I stood at the cash register waiting as Malcolm tried to figure out how to put his 'Winners' apron on. Finally, Malcolm looks at my item and says \"You're returning this? You cut off the tags\". I'm like \"Yeah, but I bought it 12 hours ago and it doesn't say on the receipt anything about keeping the tags on\". He lost it on me. He angrily pointed to this sign that Winners has that states their policy. He's all like \"You cut off the tags! You're not supposed to cut off the tags. We don't return items with the tags cut off.\" Finally he said \"Fine, this ONE time, I'll do it, but never again\". He was BY FAR one of the rudest people I have ever dealt a minute after opening. \n\nFinally he finished punching away at the register, shoved the receipt and cash on the counter and completely ignored me. I grabbed it and left the store immediately. \n\nI will never, not EVER, step foot inside this Winners again. Their service is atrocious and I urge all my fellow Yelpers to pick any place to shop but this one.",

When we went to the upstairs bar, we were greeted right away despite no open bar stools available and the bar staff came out from behind the bar to take our order. As soon as bar stools opened up, they pointed them out for us. The downstairs bar staff (especially Stephen) was friendly and attentive. We made reservations to come back for dinner on Friday.

    "text": "I want to have every meal of the day here!\n\nThis was my first experience with Flemings and it won't be my last! \nThe padres and I came here for an early dinner on a Sunday. When we arrived, we had the restaurant to our selves and settled in on our second table (my mom didn't like the first one) which was a comfy horseshoe shaped booth in the corner. I perused the wine list, which is on one of those fancy iPads, and choose a yummy Zinfandel that appeared before me in no time! \n\nI was trying to eat healthy and started with the Fleming's salad (candied walnuts and  cranberries!) and then had the New Bedford Scallops that were perfectly cooked and accompanied with a delicious lemon-honey glaze (my mouth is salavating as I write this). My mom was super boring and I honestly dont remember what she ordered, but she enjoyed it. My Dad, however, loved his dish that they only serve one day a week. On Sunday's they offer a prime rib special that includes a appetizer salad, two sides, and a dessert...you need to come on Sundays. This was one of the best prime ribs he as ever in the 35+ years he has been living in Arizona. For his/my sides he ordered the saut??ed mushrooms and the BLUE CHEESE mashed potatoes! Everything was incredibly tasty and I still had my Dad's dessert to devour! \n\nFor dessert, my Dad ordered the Carrot cake, BUT, my mom mentioned earlier that I was recently engaged and in addition to the carrot cake (which was amazing, the spice was so delicious and the cake itself was incredibly fresh and moist) we got to indulge in the super gooey Chocolate melted volcano cake (I couldn't stop eating the creamy center filled with chocolate sauce and I am NOT a chocolate person), the refreshing Pistachio ice cream with a yummy tuile (that's a fancy name for a buttery walffald/cookie/cone, thanks Andrea for helping me with my \"classy\" lessons), and, my favorite, the light, yet dense creme brulle...ugh, so good! Oh, and since they knew I was watching my figure, we also got to try their house made whipped cream that you could eat as a dessert on its own!\n\nThe food was fantastic and the serivce...more fantastical (even when the restaurant started to fell up)! From the friendly hostess who greeted us, to Adam, the server's assistant, to the BEST WAITRESS EVER, Andrea, and even the manager, Jessica, all were extremely friendly and really seemed to care about how our dining experience turned out. \n\nFive stars all the way!",

For the most part the staff was friendly and accommodating, maybe a bit too stuffy for such a fun restaurant.\nWe both had a bourbon we had never tried while we perused the menu and made our choices. \nWe're both huge steak fans and the scent of charred steak permeated the air, so we agreed to share a Rib eye from Rosewood Texas, recommended by our server.  We shared the Classic Tartare to start, it was good but I've had better and I think I prefer it with toast as opposed to the soft rolls they served it with, it's that texture thing that would've helped. We eventually got our steak, oh baby! Again it was good, but I've had better, actually at a few places, if you have meat in your name, you better serve the best meat I've ever had! \nWe shared some sides of Catalan Spinach which I loved...the flavor combos were perfect! Then we couldn't pass up the Robuchon potatoes that are described as butter, butter, more butter and some potatoes. So smooth and creamy, the first few bites are extraordinary you don't want to stop eating them but then you feel that your mouth is just coated in butter and no matter what you eat, it can not be cleansed. Ick! I craved something like lemon sorbet but alas nothing even close to it on the menu, so we got Ten Little Pieces Dessert to share and take some home for later. They were tasty morsels, just nothing to rave about.\nWe're kind of bummed at the bank roll we dropped here, just to be...\"Meh\". At least we got this place out of our system, on to the next \"I have to try\" place.",

The spicy karage had a nice kick to it. Meat was juicy with a nice crispy exterior. The dumplings were decent.

Management considers the Child and Senior advertised rates as DISCOUNTED RATES and the Corporate Coupons disallow \"double coupons\".  Since this Franchisee also considers the advertised rates as \"discounted\" will not accept them.  I have contacted the Franchisor (Regis Corp) about this but so far have gotten nowhere.  Petty, I know, however Regis and the Franchisee could be facing Discrimination and Advertising litigation.\n\nBottom line, a greedy Franchisee...BE CAREFUL if you are a Senior or parent.",

    "text": "The BLTAE is one of the best breakfast sandwiches in town! It's like your standard BLT fused with avocado toast, plus the pop of pesto and two eggs, served open-faced on thick-cut grilled brioche. It's even more fantastic than it sounds (and looks!), and I'd come back to their inconvenient downtown location with annoying garage parking just to have it again.\n\nMy guy raved just as much about the lemon poppy seed pancakes, though I would have appreciated more of the blueberry-ginger compote. I'm not much of a sugar for breakfast person, but we'll be coming back for the carrot and coconut version soon. \n\nNOTE: Full menu available even at opening, which means you can channel your inner five year old and order mac and cheese for breakfast! Unfortunately, I found the Ritz-cracker crust unnecessarily thick and salty, and the noodles overcooked. It may be best to stick to bfast options after all.",

    "text": "Usually one to avoid the chain restaurant or any place that screams concept, I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful experience I had this evening at Nothing But Noodles on Elizabeth Avenue near CPCC. \n\nAfter a very long week of work which ended in a very long Friday, my husband and I wanted a quick and painless dinner so after seeing a coupon in one of the weekly mailers (the mailers that usually sit on the counter until the coupons are expired) we decided to run out for a \"buy one get one free\" bowl of noodles.\n\nWe both ordered the rice noodles with peanut sauce and split some pot stickers.  The service was fantastic.  The cashier was very nice without being saccharine even offering to explain the menu and ordering process.  The restaurant was impeccably clean with a sanitation score of 101.5 and not a spot of dirt anywhere.  Even the back of house (although there is really no back of the house as the kitchen is fully visible) was shiny and orderly.  Someone on staff was cleaning the entire time we were there. \n\nAfter we grabbed our drinks and sat down a server/bus person brought out our pot stickers.  We ate a couple and then started on the noodles.   The noodle portion was enormous with a flavorful homemade sauce and fresh vegetables.  A must have is the Key Lime pie.  It has a great crust and although the flavor is obviously key lime the creamy pie does not leave you with a perpetual pucker.\n\nWe noticed that they also offer homemade cotton candy for the kids which along with the other very kid friendly menu options, non-smoking atmosphere, unobtrusive music and pleasant lack of TVs' makes this a very family friendly restaurant.\n\nAll of that aside it was the customer service and attention to detail that made our experience truly remarkable.  The owner of the establishment was present and working at closing on a Friday night.  He takes pride in his restaurant and has obviously passed that on to his employees.  It is really refreshing to know that a business owner cares. \n\nThank you Todd and the rest of the staff at Nothing but Noodles for an unexpected pleasure.  You really turned what was supposed to be a quick bit to eat into a great evening out.",

Omelet bar, pancakes, waffles, and French toast made in front of you, a carving station, every kind of breakfast food you could dream of, pastries on pastries, and so much more. Everything tastes amazing, and you will not go hungry or want of food- you might even get some exercise walking from room to room to find all of the different choices.

My SO does not seem to fancy it as much, but I don't know, she seems pretty satisfied every time we visit. \n\nYou've read enough about their waffles....they're the best, blah blah blah.... mm so good, blah blah.... BUT IT'S TRUE!!!!! They are so light, perfect amount of sweetness and their SYRUP is SO AWESOME. Wow, I think I conveyed my craving and excitement enough - sorry caps lock police. They also offer a cornish hen for brunch - which is a treat. Any place you can have something a little fancier/different with your standard eggs brunch is superb in my books.\n\nBut, do you know what the best part of LPD is?! The fact that I can order a savoury and sweet brunch in one plate. E.g. eggs benny with waffles! I honestly could not ask for more from a breakfast establishment.\n\n(I think I'll go here this weekend...)\n\nIt's true, the lines are ridiculous. I've swung by at prime brunch hour and the line was long enough to make me turn around and go to an alternative, but the line at 2pm - 2:30pm is bearable (just watch out, they close around 3). With that said, however, the wait time could change rapidly, obviously depending on the patrons inside. It's a gamble (odds being most likely long), but worth it.\n\nAtmosphere - 4/5\nService - 4/5\nFood - 5/5\nPrice - 3/5",

In the morning I started calling all of YELP's top rated companies. I left voicemail after voicemail then called J & K - not yet rated. Julio (owner) picked up the phone and promised to come the same day. I crossed my fingers and hoped all would work out. \n\nHe found the pilot light had gone out. Didn't charge me, but I asked him to come back and do routine maintenance - including replacing my filters and also insulting the outside water pipe to my home (he does plumbing too.) His charge? $60 for everything including all materials.\n\nBut what really set J & K apart from the several companies that have serviced my heating, cooling and plumbing needs before is instead of using his knowledge and expertise to get me to spend more money - he told me I didn't have to spend as much as before.\n\nSo I made another appointment for him to repair some plumbing problems I have in my master bath - the same problems I had repaired in my 2nd bath. I paid close to $700 for those repairs - Julio quoted $120, including materials and labor.\n\nI will report if my future experience differs from these, but I'm thinking this is a homeowner's dream - competent, no attitude, priced honestly, licensed professional. Now if he just did all the other kinds of house repairs I need done....",

It took a little bit of asking around to find the VIP ticket booth, but all I had to do was find the right person to ask. \n\nWhen my date and I first got there we walked around and noticed all of the very cool bars. Our favorite themes were the one that looked like candy land, and American Gladiators. We loved that each bar would make us their signature drink. \n\nThe VIP area was very nice and a great place to rest your feet from all of the dancing. It did however, take people too long to get dancing. C'mon people, get on the dance floor! All of the people working the event were great, I could not have asked for better service. However, some of the people who attended were not gentlemen, but it's something you have to anticipate with all of the great drinks to be had. \n\nAll in all a great night! Thanks Nikki, Kelly and I had a blast!",

However that anxiety was soon changed to happiness as I hungrily explored their expansive menu.  \n\nSushi Hero did a lot of modernizing to this place and although the other place was awesome, this place has a huge menu, amazing staff, fresh fish, and a great ambiance.  \n\nEverything I ate exploded in my mouth with a variety of delicious flavors.  I will definitely be back, there are so many items I have yet to try.\n\nIt's definitely among my favorite all you can eat sushi places, not just on the East side  but in all the city.  If you're nearby, you owe it to your taste buds to give Sushi Hero a try.  Ask not what your taste buds can do for you, but what you can do for your taste buds.",

Although I used to love their delivery service, I scheduled a delivery for Thursday between 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. and at 9:45 I received a call that they couldn't make it that day, but I could schedule a 2-hour window for Friday once customer service opened in the morning.  Called Friday morning and scheduled a delivery between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m., then worked from home to accommodate this delivery since I need my groceries for a dinner party Saturday that I'll have to start prepping Saturday morning.  At noon I was called and told that no one would deliver my groceries today.  After speaking with a customer services manager, AK, I was told someone would call me to make their best effort to arrange the delivery today.  An hour later, I get a call assuring me my groceries would NOT be delivered today but that I'd be called by customer service about delivery first thing Saturday morning.  It's now 3:30 and I've heard nothing from anyone.  Looks like I'll be waiting for my refund and getting my groceries at Fry's Food Stores tomorrow morning.",

Our server (the owner) checked up on us frequently and asked if we needed anything else. I got the fish and chips, and they were amazing!

I've tried most kebobs and my favorite is Sultani Kabob - a combination of chunks of filet Mignon and lean ground beef. Rice is perfect, too. It's always freshly prepared. \nDecor is very nice - perhaps similar to other locations. It features a famous (and my favorite) picture of an Afghan girl taken by Steve McCurry (google Sharbat Gula).\nThis location is fairly new in The Great Punjab Business Centre. One can go Indian grocery or fabric shopping while in that area. The Centre is large but not very frequented by locals - Bamiyan Kabob seems to be the busiest of all in the area.",

    "text": "This is so exciting. A new bakery moved into the space next door to my office. Not only do they bake fresh breads and buns on site, but they also serve Cha Time Bubble Tea in the same location. And to top it off, they also have fresh baguettes. And what's more, it's a Taiwanese chain and full of fancy buns that are not easily found not just in the hood but in the entire GTA! So I think this place has a LOT of potential for greatness. The space is awesome, the vibe is inviting and definitely feels like the kind of place I want in my hood. The only room for improvement is some of the bread are kind of dry. I would definitely suggest they work on that. For example matcha red bean was super dry. But some of the other bread such as the sweet taro bun was moist and lightly sweetened. I also loved the bacon twist bread. It went perfectly with my dinner and I can forsee me buying lots and lots of it in the future. \n\nGrand opening is on 9/17 but the place was packed when I went on the soft opening earlier in the week. It's currently cash only but hopefully they will setup the machines soon. Lots of samples to introduce you to all the flavours of breads, buns, cakes... Great selection, around 20 or so? Prices are reasonable for fancy bread with a range from $2-5 from what I saw. I still have a lot more to try but so far, LOVE!",

Our waiter was very nice and helped me order since it was my first time being here. I ordered a pancake with bananas it was sweet n tasty, what I like about the pancakes here is that the ingredients (bananas, chocolate chips,etc) are actually baked in the pancakes they are not just tossed on top. Another great thing about the pancakes they are actually baked it makes a great difference they are sooo fluffy in the inside and on the outer side of the pancake crispy, yummy! I only ate half of the pancake. I also ordered there breakfast platter; 2 sunny side eggs were warm and tasty I ate only one , 2 sizzling sausages ate half of 1, and evenly cooked hash browns only ate a spoonful. Lastly I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy and omg they are the best I have ever tasted I highly recommend trying them out! They come with 2 biscuits I only ate one I so wanted to save the other one for later. I tried a little bit of everything I didn't finish everything and not because the food wasn't to die for but, because I did order a lot of food couldn't fit everything in my stomach. I guess I got carried away lol I so wanted to try everything on the menu.",

Stopped in yesterday and ordered the smoked pork belly buns and Tonkotsu ramen. First, the pork belly rolls didn't have a spongy light texture, they were closer to a biscuit texture than a roll. The pork itself was nothing to write home about - most of the fat was rendered off causing it to be quite dry. The ramen is only as good as the broth that comprises its base. Futo's didn't have that silky unctuous flavor of a protein meat base, more like bone soup. The ramen noodles and mushrooms were the bright spots. David Chang - Charlotte needs you !",

For those of you who have not been to a Japanese BBQ, think of those AYCE Korean BBQ places, but with better cuts of meats that are individually laid out on a tray rather than plopped in a bowl.  \n\nI arrived earlier than my group, so I sat at the bar for a beer.  The happy hour was $2.50 draft beers and I took full advantage of it!  Our group sat at a booth - they've designed the restaurant to maximize booth space, cause you know, no one likes to sit close to a stranger.  They also air vents built right into the grill, so all the smoke gets sucked out before it even floats upwards.  Now, while you won't go home reeking of smoke, you also won't get the delightful smells of BBQ here as well.  \n\nWe ordered two of their group sets, which I love.  It takes the work of picking the individual meats and sides out of my hands.  Food just magically appears!\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Gyu-Kaku if you're looking for a nice place to have a BBQ dinner.",

There was a slight chemical aftertaste in our selections--a small reminder this restaurant was in the business of making mass-produced, similar goodies in other locations. My Taho and our hot items didn't look very appealing in its disposable container--it looked like a rushed job of grabbing to-go containers from a birthday party.\n\nGLANCING AROUND\nOur cashier was very friendly, but with so many bodies dancing behind the counter, it was no surprise to witness some confusion in the interactions between the employees and the customers before and after my order. The dining area is very simple and plain--reminiscent of the old, old fast food places before they decided to upgrade.\n\nI believe this place will stay busy from the mere belief most of its patrons are visiting Filipinos who want something somewhat reminiscent of home.",

Why can't it be downtown, closer home so I can go every week?\n\nThe place is not very spacious, so I made reservations and we were promptly seated by a pleasant hostess. The menu is well picked, the flavors are huuuge,and the food presentation is great! The hostess doubles up as a server so at times the service can be a tad slow but totally worth the wait.\n\nWe started off with fritters, and boy was I surprised! The fritters came in casings made of pappadoms and were garnished with a smattering of sauces and salts. The complimentary mango salsa is a take home worthy product! So good!\n\nMy dining partner ordered the vegetarian sampler which had a grilled cauliflower, a cheese dumpling aka kofta and delicious lentils! I ordered the non vegetarian platter which had jumbo shrimp cooked three different ways: grilled, in coconut sauce and in mustard. Each prep was so different from the other and so, so good. The combination of traditional spices in non traditional ways resulted in uniformly great flavors.\n\nWe weren't sure about ordering dessert cuz we were stuffed at this point, but the server gave us a complementary dessert platter which had cheese cake made out of cottage cheese(very decadent and I've never had this before); blueberries, and gelato ( I think). The ensuing food coma was one of the best I've ever had.\n\nDinner for two came to $80 with tip and tax (but sans alcohol and with complimentary dessert). Worth every penny.",

I ordered over medium and both times they were less cooked than over easy. \n\nThe breakfast potatoes were soggy when they should've been crisp. Definitely taken out of a warming tray. \n\nThe pancakes which was the whole reason we came here were tough! I couldn't cut thru them with a fork and i had to stop eating after 1 bite because chewing the hard shell was too much for me. \n\nCoffee was only refilled once. For a breakfast that costs $30, I expect it to be fresh. And I got something less than that. \n\nI finally settled on eating the soggy potatoes after he took my eggs away. I gave the pancakes away to my fianc??. His omelet was bland at best.",

The Christmas lights strung in the window is what caught my eye and led me here. \n\nWe were warmly greeted by a husband and wife team. We were the only diners at the time, he gave us a very thorough run down of the menu items and had suggested the CC Sizzle, we picked Nacho Style. This was delicious. It was a blend of meat with onions, cabbage and cheese over their homemade tortilla chips. Our second item was the Green Chile Enchiladas, made with Hatch green chili's and chicken with creamy chili's sauce. I couldn't decide which one I liked more. \n\nWe ended the meal with Sopaipillas. Probably one of the best I've ever tasted. I like mine with honey, and they had a few different types to choose from. \n\nThis place is really casual. Even if you're dining in, your food is served in styrofoam to go container. The soda fountain wasn't working when we were there, bummer, I like a nice cold Coke when I'm eating Mexican food (only time I like soda). The owners were really nice, he was telling us all about where they're from in NM. I'm definitely planning to return and try some of their other dishes.",

Everything was okay, nothing blew my mind other than the two sauces that came with the steaks - red wine and peppercorn. We had the seafood appetizer, chili cheese fries, 14 oz sirloin with the ultimate Mac&Cheese, filet and lobster, and chicken. Our sirloin was cooked well but had a lot of chewy fat and gristle. The chili cheese fries and the mac&cheese both came out a little differently than expected but were good. The prices were typical Vegas prices, higher than the quality of the food in this case.

I went in the evening and at that time of day, I'm typically exhausted from my 2 small children... I had an appointment with Al, he was so nice and asked me questions about what I needed out of a massage.  He suggested Ashiatsu, which I had never heard of actually... I also missed the memo that he'd actually use his feet at times... all I know is- it was the best massage I have ever had!  The hot stones were amazing, and all I could think about was coming back in the winter for another one!  Don't be weirded out about feet- like I said, I had no idea until it was over.  You will miss out on the best massage ever if you overthink this!  My only suggestion would be to have the client choose between 2 scents with the oils.  The oil he used was fine during the massage, but when I left, I wasn't as much of fan.  Thanks so much to Al- you're amazing!",

First of all why are all the waitresses wearing street clothes? At least have an apron around ur waist?? The wait for the food was way too long and during the wait they didnt even bring us water, I had to ask for it. Also, that button on the table? Ya it doesnt work. Why is it even there if its not going to be functioning properly?? The food was honestly too expensive, around 20 dollars for a few pieces of ribs. This was also the first korean restaurant that didnt have appetizers and the funnier thing was that when we asked about the appetizer the waitress seemed to be in awe that we expect side dishes from a korean restaurant... A few days later I come back wanting to give them another chance. I asked for a pork bone soup, they were out of that, I asked for their bbq ribs they were out of that too and mind you it was 8pm when I went there and they close at 2:45am. I then asked the waitress what she recommends and she says the beef tofu soup. The soup literally had 3 small pieces of beef and a few pieces of tofu!!! And my friend ordered bibimbap, this was also my first time seeing bibimbap in a regular bowl rather than a stone pot. Do yourself a favour and dont waste your time and money at this place.",

But, on that monthly trip I'm immediately irritated if I go inside. Generally I'm the only person at the Rx counter and there are 2-4 employees working. No one acknowledges you for at least 1-2 minutes; it's like they have a timer and can't speak before it goes off. Then, all they say is \"Be right with you\".  When someone does finally ask your name they dig through, find your Rx, make you sign the insurance book and cash you out with no more words. It's really amazing how little communication goes on. \n\nThe drive-thru pickup, if it doesn't have a long-line is slightly better for some reason. Not personable at all but at least a bit quicker. \nI'm really just rather meh about the place and wish there was a local pharmacy that took my insurance.",

Funny enough, another customer had brought her car in for inspection to renew her tags and he told her they weren't actually due until March 2014, not March 2013 as she thought and he was happy to send her on her way if she wanted to wait on it. Really happy with his service and will definitely come back!",

We are constantly on the hunt for great tacos in any city, this was definitely one for our list. \nWe ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best. \nNormally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Fresca's ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side.",

They also understand that said grumpy vegan ladies do not, in fact; enjoy a grey bean-y discus that has been microwaved, until hateful and rubbery. \n\nFor all these things, Clive has won a place in my heart. Pile all the toppings you want on a vegan burger ~*that actually tastes mouthwatering*~, or a cow burger (I won't judge you, I promise... O_o) at no extra charge! The only extras they charge you for are a fried egg and bacon. Take your Celiac friend to a burger joint, without fear of the cops showing up at your door later that evening to arrest you for attempted murder! Personable, friendly (and attractive!) staff, that nudge you toward the vegan - not veggie burger (the veggie burger uses eggs as a binder) because they genuinely want you to have the best experience at their establishment possible. \n\nThe only thing I didn't fall in love with were Clive's fries. The ones at the top of the bag I received, were delicious! But after breaking that first layer; the rest were too salty, gummy and greasy. Sorry, Clive. Maybe if I had spread them out, like the ladybee next to me, they wouldn't have gotten so chewy? I'll give them another try next time, because I hella love potatoes. I do love that they are generous with them, so on my next visit I'll take a cue from other reviewers and split an order with a homie. \n\nLove the atmosphere, the adorable drawings of food everywhere - even on the staff tees; the commitment to having a simple and locally sourced menu, and being environmentally friendly. Thanks for existing, Clive!",

    "text": "I have been taking my car to the Bethany Home Rd. and 7th Street location for many years. I always worked with George the Manager who is now no longer there unfortunately. George was always great, helpful, friendly and seemed to be very honest in what repairs needed to be done.\n\nI took my car there last week for an oil and filter change. I dropped off my car with Mike who was not friendly at all, seemed pre-occupied with whatever other work he was doing and I felt like he truly wasn't listening to me when I talked to him about what I needed done.\n\nWhen I picked up my car, I spoke to Scott who was at least a bit nicer and he went through and explained what their suggestions were for future car repairs and the pricing but I still didn't get a great feeling from him that I would be taken care. I had my breaks done there sometime back so it will be time to get them replaced soon and since they are on a lifetime warranty, all I would need to pay for is the labor which he said would be $60. Since he quoted me a price last week, I naturally thought that information would be saved in the computer system for when I was ready to get it worked on. \n\nToday, I called to confirm the price and make an appointment to take my car in. Mike answered and at first quoted me $139.99. I then said that Scott had quoted me a different amount. Mike then quoted me $70.00. I again said that that was not the amount Scott had quoted me. At that time, he asked what Scott had quoted me and I told him $60.00. He said if Scott quoted me that then they'd honor it. What I don't understand is, why wasn't Scott's original quote already in the system in my file? Why am I being given another 2 higher quotes? If I'm a \"valued customer\" why am I not given the correct and lower quote right away? And furthermore, how am I supposed to trust what they are telling me is correct on what needs to be done? I hate playing this game and shouldn't have to for a place that I've been going to for years. It's quite frustrating.",

Not only did we get a good variety of food to try, but we got an excellent history lesson about Montreal from our tour guide, Kim.\n\nWe rolled into the Mile End food tour as a group of 10 and were joined by 2 other couples, rounding out our tour group number at 14 people. I won't go too in-depth at all of our stops, but i would highly recommend this tour, based on how our guide took us from stop to stop and passionately described the food we were eating and the history behind it. We made stops at the following locations:\n\nLa Panthere Verte - for falafel\nChocolats Genevieve Grandbois - for chocolate tasting\nSt-Viateur Bagel - for Montreal bagel tasting\nRialto Theatre - to tour the former movie palace\nDrogheria Fine - for Gnocchi\nBoucherie Lawrence - for meat-tasting\nKem Comba - for ice cream\n\nTo summarize, all of the food and snacks were fantastic. Not a single disappointment in what we were served at each stop or the information we were given. If I had to do it again, I wouldn't change a thing as not only did we get a full meal and more with Kim, but as I stated earlier, she was excellent in explaining to us the history of the city.",

I admit the pulled pork was good and not characteristically dry like how most pulled pork is.  However, the pulled pork poutine pales in comparison to the original regular poutine.  Goat cheese & BBQ sauce can't replace the fatty A magic of cheese curds & gravy.  Reggie's uses chicken gravy, which is very good.  This might possibly be my favorite poutine place.\n\nI hear their Monte Cristo is good.  If I'm willing to wean myself off of poutine, maybe I'll try it one day.",

I usually get dragged to a yogurt dessert after eating ridiculously large meals, so thank goodness it's lower in fat! I'm 5'6\" and trying to keep up with a 6'2\" man's metabolism here. \n\nYogurtland has been our favorite. They have an excellent selection with a wide variety of flavors and toppings. We tried a bunch of flavors and both ended up doing a strawberry/cheesecake mix with strawberries, blueberries, and walnuts on top. We also added a few of their little cheese cake bites. Their yogurt's taste and texture is perfect.  \n\nWhen the cashier rang us up, we thought she had only totalled one of our yogurts by accident.... could it be only $6 for two pretty fully loaded cups of yogurt?? Normally, ONE yogurt runs us $5-6. Not only is it good, it's cheap too?! That gets my stamp of approval.",

This time my sister and I had the good fortune to work with Christina F.  Turns out she is dating Joe who helped us last year (and was amazing) although he has moved on to the real estate industry.  Christina actually remembered us from last year and was so much fun.  We bought several things and then my sister mentioned a DY bracelet she had (purchased at Saks) where stone had fallen out a couple of days prior.  Christina was all over it and told my sis to bring in the next day and they would send off for replacement.  Wow!  I love this place.  I'm not gonna buy Yurman any place but here.  Oh, and did I mention that on Saturday they had a DJ?  And they have beverages and snacks?  We didn't indulge in bubbly until after we made our purchases, just to be sure we did it with sound mind.  :)",

They have a rather small restaurant, and during the lunch hours it can get fairly packed.  The restaurant is tactfully decorated to match it's ethnic background.  \n\nThe menu here is fairly simple with some basic but creative dishes.  My favorite by far has been the spicy basil fried rice with chicken.  It is spot on with some vegetables and rice as well as having a good amount of kick to it.  If you aren't a huge fan of heat, you can choose to have a lower heat level for any dish.  Last time I was here, my wife ordered pineapple rice with chicken.  She thoroughly enjoyed it which had some sizable chunks of pineapple and other vegetables.  The only complaint I would have is I've noticed a less than ideal amounts of chicken in the dishes.  Other than that, the portion typically is more than a single meal.\n\nThis is a cool place to have some good Thai food.  If you are nervous about trying Thai, but enjoy rice dishes, this will be a great place to start! I've also had their pad Thai here and it was extremely excellent.  Not a bad price for a downtown meal and their service, food, and staff has been very consistent.",

We had the lobster tacos, calamari, rock shrimp and some tuna for appetizers. I had a excellent sirloin that came with two types of sauces on the side a au poive pepper sauce and a red wine sauce that were both delicious. others in the party ordered the Salmon and Sea Bass that looked great. For side dishes we had the creamy spinach, lobster mashed potatoes  and sauteed mushrooms they seemed a little salty by themselves but with the steak it evened out nicely. For dessert we had the fried donuts that came with a banana and chocolate sauce. Not the cheapest meal to be had but certainly one of the best. I liked the atmosphere in the place it had a nice modern feel to it and the wavy wood panel ceiling was cool. Plus I was told they like hiring hostesses that are tall :)",

While the restaurant does look pretty nice (high windowed ceilings, lots of natural light, etc.), the food and service are both just kind of mediocre.\n\nAppetizer: Goat Cheese Flat Bread (sundried tomato pesto, arugula, fresh basil, fire roasted red peppers). I ordered this because I love goat cheese and arugula, and it tasted just fine. The flat bread was a bit harder than I expected though, like I kind of forgot it was flat bread and felt like I was eating a cracker at times.\n\nMain: Beef Bourguignon. This sounds really fancy, but really it's just like beef stew. I don't know if in reality it is actually supposed to be fancy, but the one at Trios was kind of a let down. I mean, you would expect there to be some variation in flavour, but ultimately the stew just tasted... salty. Like super salty. Apparently there were pearl onions, crimini mushrooms and double smoked bacon in the stew, but really, I have no recollection of any of that stuff. Really it was all just beef, salt, and mashed potatoes in my memories.\n\nDessert: Triple Cream Brie with fig preserve, spiced pecans and crostini. I actually really enjoyed this. The brie was not too strong in flavour and really was very creamy. It was delicious on its own as well as with the sweet fig preserve. This was definitely my favourite part of the meal.\n\nService: It seemed like the servers were trying... and they were all really nice, but I was confused. Considering the restaurant really was NOT busy, they were surprisingly absent for a lot of the time. Besides coming out to take our orders and bring us our food, for the most part they were nowhere to be seen. I remember this especially being a problem after we had all had our beef stews, and one of my friends specifically had to request to have our waters refilled because they were all low and we were all dying of thirst. Sooo can't say I was terribly impressed with this either.\n\nOverall: Definitely a little disappointed - maybe a little bit less so if the lunch had been in the cheapest category ($18) but I don't think it was worth the $23 price tag we paid.",

I could tell he was bummed when he poked around at his steak with furrowed eyebrows, cutting off piece after piece of inedible meat.\n\n  I was really hoping to please him since it was his birthday.

I really expect a little something special if we are spending our special day at their establishment.\n\n  The waitstaff was prompt and friendly.  They seemed to linger around and dive right in when you need a refill on your drink, or in my case another great martini.  I almost forgot to mention that I loved their martinis.  \n\nWill we return?  Definitely no.  There are way more better restaurants in Vegas.

They had lots of passed hors d'oeuvres at the start of the reception, and while I appreciated the variety, some were really great and others were just so-so. The lamb chops and the lobster wontons were stand-outs. Dinner was steak, and I think it was alright, but thanks to the martinis and manhattans, I don't remember many details about the dinner. There was karaoke at the reception, which was kind of awesome, only complaint is that the DJ was really cheesy, even compared to other wedding DJs.",

Montr??al pour qui veut magasiner ou veut sortir.\nA 2 pas de la place des Arts, c'est donc l'emplacement id??al pour qui veut profiter des festivals. Revers ??vident, vous en profiterez de toutes fa??ons ! Par confort, j'ai opt?? pour des bouchons d'oreilles et cela a suffi ?? rendre mes nuits plus silencieuses ( ?? 4$ les 5 paires, l'investissement n'??tait pas ruineux).\nL'acc??s est tr??s facile : le bus de l'a??roport et le m??tro arrivent ?? un bloc de distance (mais pas le m??me :-) ). \n\nEn arrivant ?? pied ?? l'h??tel, vous aurez peut-??tre remarqu?? quelques th????tres pour adultes. Il y a effectivement quelques m??tres de trottoirs consacr??es aux plus de 18 ans, et le voisinage de l'h??tel ne fait pas exception. Cependant, il n'y a rien de malsain dans cet entourage : apr??s tout, on est au c??ur de la ville.\n\nLa r??ception est situ??e au premier ??tage, escalier obligatoire. Nous avons ??t?? tr??s bien accueillis avec un enregistrement rapide assorti de nombreux conseils et de la documentation indispensable pour commencer notre s??jour.\nNous avions opt?? pour une chambre ??conomique avec salle de douche commune. La surface modeste de la chambre ??tait compens??e par un haut plafond et un grand placard, nous n'??tions donc pas encombr??s par nos bagages. \n\nIl y avait 3 salles de douche pour l'??tage. Elles ??taient nettoy??es plusieurs fois dans la journ??e et je ne me suis jamais retrouv??e ?? attendre. Ce n'est qu'?? de rares occasions que j'ai trouv?? des traces indiquant le passage d'autres h??tes, alors m??me que l'h??tel ??tait plein.\nLe wifi ne passe pas tr??s bien dans les ??tages. Comme la chambre ??tait juste au-dessus de la r??ception, nous avons pu en profiter. Autrement, les fauteuils de la r??ception vous accueilleront pour votre surf.\nPour le petit d??jeuner, je crois que l'h??tel a un accord avec un restaurant tout proche. De notre c??t??, nous avons pr??f??r?? profiter des nombreux caf??s de Montr??al.\n\nEn conclusion, si vous recherchez le silence et le design, vous serez certainement frustr??s. Par contre, si vous recherchez une position centrale, un h??tel propre et simple avec un accueil sympa et chaleureux, je ne peux que vous conseiller l'Abri du voyageur qui porte tr??s bien son nom.",

La sal??e ??tait 100 fois meilleure cette fois-ci comme ils ont ajout?? du citron. Pour accompagner la viande, avant, ils donnaient un genre de cake de carottes avec les f??ves blanches ?? l'int??rieur et personne ?? aim??. On voulait m??me pas en rapporter dans nos doggy bags. Ils ont remplac?? ce plat par une genre de bouillie bien ??pic??e de f??ves blanches avec des carottes caram??lis??es dans le sirop d'??rable. Mega upgrade, jai ador??. Tout ??a servi avec une bonne miche de pain maison.\n\nLes desserts, quantit?? industrielle de desserts, soit la tire d??licieuses dans un banc de granit?? ?? la menthe.

And let me tell you, I walked into a SuperPawn Cash America last night JUST to get a quote on a loan, and my preconceived notions were definitely confirmed-- I was low-balled-- they offered 10% of what I got from Max Pawn. Take my words with a grain of salt, but you definitely have a bunch of different apples around town and Max Pawn is the good one in the barrel. \n\nI've been to this location twice now, once to sell electronic accessories I didn't need and just wanted cash for (and was too lazy to try eBay for), and once, now, to get a loan to help me through a difficult time. I am the worst possible person when it comes to remembering names, but two really kind and professional gentlemen helped me out when it came to checking my gear out, then processing the loan. \n\nTimes are tough, and Max Pawn offered me two friendly experiences with non-judgmental people. For pawn shop newbies, the interest rate for a month is still applicable if you pay them back in a day. I plan to be repaying the loan in two weeks, and am confident my items will be well-stored and safe until I return. \n\nThough kind of cheesy, I really want to thank the people here for allowing me to maintain some financial independence as I sort things out. Thank you so much! I will be sending you all as much business as I can. Your staff is awesome and your establishment is cleaner than a department store.\n\nCheck them out if you're on this side of town, and make an adventure out of it if you're not.",

The place is clean, very easy to schedule an appointment, only 3/4 of a mile from the strip. As my schedule is often in flux, I often don't call to schedule an appointment until the day before and I'm able to get in easily, even on weekends. I've had massages from two people here, one time with Joe and a couple of times with Debbie. Joe likes to talk. He'll tell you all about the famous people he's worked on over the years when he was at Caesar's. His Old Vegas stories are interesting, but I prefer less conversation. The other thing about Joe is he really works you over. I prefer gentle and more relaxing. After Joe, I felt like I needed a massage to recover from his massage!  I think Joe is in demand and has a loyal clientele, it was just a little too intense for me. I've had Debbie a couple of times and I now request her. Minimal conversation, gentle, relaxing. I go a half hour early, sit in the steam room for 15-20 minutes, shower, have my massage, hit the jacuzzi for a few minutes, clean up and leave.

They certainly have something for everyone. The portions and the presentation made the higher price point easily justified. Combine that with the friendly staff and live entertainment, it was a wonderful experience. This is one of those places where the waitstaff makes you feel like you're a part of the family. I honestly will go back as much for the staff as I will for the food. Definitely worth a visit. \n\nNOTE- If you don't like cilantro, the meatloaf will not be for you. It's an interesting recipe that is fairly heavy on cilantro both inside the loaf and as a garnish.",

It was such a headache and impossible to follow!\nUntil I met Cassidy and her awesome team!!! WOW, these guys are in top of it, always pricing out better options for me, on top of my payments and making sure I'm always current.\nI would say the best thing is the personal care you get, it's as if they actually care about saving you every dime (even when you don't care for it) while maintaining a booklet proof insurance coverage for you and your loved ones.\n\nI highly recommend Cassidy and her crew to anyone who owns anything ;)",

The place was actually really empty, which wasn't too surprising since it was a Tuesday evening.\nThe host was very accommodating with people from our group arriving late and ordering at different times. Can't remember his name but he was so helpful and patient the entire time.\nThe menu selection is pretty big! There's lots of Greek choices like pita, falafel, and souvlaki, as well as a variety of more Americanized options like pizza, pasta, calzones, sandwiches, and burgers. I had the Big Fat Greek Burger and it was a huuuuge portion. Like multiple toppings such as tomatoes and feta, with a burger patty AND plenty of gyro meat, plus it came with fries! Sooo much food.\nThe portions of other food looked pretty big too; other members of my group got lamb chops, Florentine pizza, calzone (which is also really big!), pasta, Greek nachos, and they all really enjoyed the food!\nPlus it was happy hour so they had specials like $3 drinks, $4-5 appetizers, $19 pitchers of sangria, and I think they had half off bottles of wine that day.\nBasically, if you're craving Greek food (or pizza/pasta) in Tempe, My Big Fat Grewk Restaurant is definitely worth a try!",

The only problem I have is that he seems to be a bit understaffed so I felt bad asking for bread that would usually come out before the meal. Husand had chicken marsala and it was excellent, I enjoyed my eggpalant. Not a five star place but it's definitely better then Olive Garden or Carrabas!",

    "text": "I've been to the Liberty a total of three times:\n\nThe first was during restaurant week- the highlight of my meal was a dessert that was a gooey chocolatey cake with a chocolate stout shooter...but its not on their regular menu and that makes me sad. \n\nThe second I went for the Mac N Cheese - which was meh to say the least. I ended up exchanging it because I didn't care for it, dry, over-herbed which was strange because it almost was bland. \n\nToday I went with some coworkers and had the lunch special. For about $8.50 you get the chicken burger with bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickle herbed aioli- more mayo textured, pimento cheese served on a delicious bun. This is served with fries, \"dessert\", and soda/Iced Tea. Great deal! \n\n The  burger itself was pretty good although I'm not sure I would be back based on that alone. The fries were really good (fresh cut and herby) but when I asked for a side of ranch (don't judge) it was watery blue cheese- ick, and since I'm not a ketchup girl I wished there was a thinner aioli or something just for those...then they would be perfection! \n\nThe dessert was a mean joke- basically they were like a Little Debbie-esque snack pecan pie with wrapping left on. I was really disappointed and wish they just made a fresh cookie or just left it out all together. \n\nThis would have earned 3 stars but our service was terrible.\n\n Aloof describes our waiter perfectly well. Drinks were left unfilled, he couldn't bother to crack a smile, and he put our checks in the middle of the table (hey we all got the same thing you could have just passed it around to us politely). We had one to-go order which was the special and a salad - this took longer than all of the other meals, even though that was ordered at the same time- she was leaving early so that was definitely a problem...he also failed to mention that he added 20% gratuity- which at $1.70 a piece wasn't a big deal but it's always a bit sketch when they don't say it outright. It seemed like he knew he was getting gratuity added so he didn't bother to be friendly....so -1 star based on service alone.",

We ordered 2 waters and a black tea. 15 minutes later the drinks came. Wow. I was in ahh on how long it took to get our drinks out. They also brought out chips and 2 sides of salsa. Those were ok at best. I ordered the number #23. Thats a 3 item combo. I chose 2 cheese enchiladas and 1 beef burrito. My food was excellent i enjoyed it. However it took 37 minutes to get to me. My wife also ordered a #23. She had 1beef buritto and 2 chicken tacos. The buritto she said was ok and the tacos were just plain and terrible. She stated she woud rather have \"Robertos\" next time. My mother ordered a shrimp dish and she stated it was good but she requested no avacados. When her meal arrived it had avacados everywhere. There was NO apology for the mistake. The waiter just walked off. We had to damn near beg to get a refill on our waters. The check came out in 2 minutes. They got that done fast. It wad $50.00 i feel as if i was robbed. The only thing they wanted was my money. Crappy service. I will go somewhere else next time. Thumbs down!",

Seriously?  How hard is it to create a topping list, laminate it and have it available for your customers??  And your menu is an electronic board. It cannot be added?\n\nI won't be back to this location.",

Not your typical diner though, they do it right! Perfect for the Vegas morning recovery meal. \n\nI normally opt for the corned beef hash. They make it crispy which just takes the hash to the next level. \n\nAnother favorite is the chicken fried steak. Juicy and crispy all at the same time. Wonderful!\n\nThis time I tried something new. The chicken fried chicken. Basically just like the chicken fried steak but with chicken. Wow! Same juicy result, different meat. Loved it. Of course anything greasy probably tastes good after a night of drinking, games, and whatever, but this place is now permanently etched in as the default for breakfast. Do it!",

    "text": "Don't believe the hype like I did. I've since removed all of my positive feedback regarding this company because of how they treated me as a customer and how they treat their employees. \nI used them over 7 months on a 3 wk rotation. So this review is not based on 1 or 2 services. This is an observation over time. \nSometimes they didn't show up on time (no big deal), no call no showed me twice and rarely sent 2 people (a very big deal). One housekeeper doing the work of 2, while you are paying for two is no good. In my opinion, the housekeeper is being overworked as Im sure the housekeeper is getting the same pay whether they have another set of hands or not. I did NOT like that. The work should be divided properly between 2 people. Like other companies. \n \nI hired another company (see my review) who ALWAYS send 2, they are cheaper, they clean the windows and blinds without charging \"extra\" and  have never \"no call no showed\" me. Both ladies are in and out in 1.5 hours TOPS with more completed.\nEverytime Superb Maids no called no showed or couldn't send 2 people, I always got a bunch of excuses (Mostly using my square footage as an excuse to not consistently send 2) \nAs a client it's no fun waiting 3- 4 hours at home on your day off to:\nA) Have one maid show up to do the work of two which takes twice as long. (Basic things would get missed, like cleaning the floor around the toilet, top of the range and fridge, bathroom mirrors, etc.) I don't want to pay for a service, lose 4 hours of my day, so I can go over and clean missed things after she left. \nB) Wait at home for NO ONE to show up. (Also very frustrating).\nThe impression I got is, if you have a small house/condo, they arent really interested in your business and will skip you on your scheduled rotation for a bigger, more expensive, client.\n\nEdit: You have a bot auto posting  for you? Elena, I wouldn't call a 1 star review anything to be excited about.",

I sat in the waiting room for about an hour, waited on a bed for another hr just to find out that I didn't break any thing. At that time I was put on a cash account because I didn't have insurance. The agreed upon price I was told I had 14 days to pay was a little over $400. So at that point I had to wait until I got my check at the end of the week. 5 days latter I got a bill for almost $3,000! I was never given the full 14 days to pay and when I tryed to talk to them about this issue all I got was runaround. Found a little to late that this is one of the worst rated hospitals in the vally.  Please don't make the same mistake I did, try a Banner hospital they are 100 times betture.",

Impossible Burger (Plant proteins, fat from coconut oil, and heme which is an ingredient found in all living things, that gives meet its flavor. We get our plant-based heme from fermentation. The impossible burger contains no animal products). Amazing that it is plant based and tastes so much like a moist burger. Order with rye bread, which adds a lot of flavor to the sandwich.

As such there were only us and three other groups in the restaurant for lunch on a Saturday.  This was common for all of the restaurants there.  The interior decor is great, with a lot of solid woodwork that makes you realize that a lot of work went into making this place.\n\nWe were seated promptly, and our waitress explained the daily specials to us.  I chose to have the guiness beef stew.  I almost always order beef stew at most Irish restaurants, but my Irish friends never serve beef stew at home.  I wonder why?\n\nThis stew actually had a little bit of a spicy pepper kick to it.  Nothing to set your taste buds on fire, but enough to make you take notice.\n\nMy vegetarian daughter managed to get one of the \"special\" pasta dishes without any of the meat as her meal, and the restaurant was kind enough to deduct a couple of dollars from the meal since they didn't have to give her meat.",

The food was great, the service was even better.\n\nI'm in Cleveland for work, been traveling non-stop lately and feeling especially miserable. Was looking for some Asian food when I stumbled across Bac, Asian Fusion, didn't expect much. I got there during happy hour ($5 starters so I got 3...), there was only 1 waitress so took a bit of time, but she was exceedingly nice. When you are alone in a strange city, a friendly smile really goes a long way, and nice service at a restaurant after a miserable long day makes such a difference.\n\nThe food was delicious, more fusion than Asian, but awesome nontheless. I got the coconut crepe, gyoza, and lemon grass crab cakes. Coconut crepe was my favorite, I ate it so fast I didn't even stop to snap a photo! Crispy on the the outside, tender and moist on the inside, stuffed with crunchy bean sprouts, shrimp and ground pork, good balance of savory with sweetness of the coconut flavor, the texture reminds of a Chinese breakfast dish called \"\". The lemon grass crab cake was lightly seasoned, just a hint of lemon grass, and comes with an amazing chili aioli sauce, I think I will take all my crab cakes with chili from now on. The gyoza was my lease favorite, nothing wrong with them, just that gyoza never tastes as good as my homemade ones, I don't know why I bother to order gyoza at restaurants.",

There were maybe 8 guests...it was a bit odd.\nMy girl and I took some time to explore, and finally made our way to the trailer to order some food.\nStaff was very friendly. We had a tuna melt and a Chicago dog. Though the tuna was good, it was not what I expected in that it was in a hoagie roll and so was not a melt in the traditional sense. The bread was dry and crunchy. It'd have been nice to have this information beforehand. So, good but disappointing. The dog was good. We also had corn which was good.\n\nAdditionally we grabbed Bloody Mary's at a bar stand. Very full of stuff but the mix was especially bitter, or vinegary. I am not a fan. Another quirky disappointment that might best to be explained to newbies, which I proclaimed.\n\nAlso, valet parking for an empty parking lot? No thanks. \n\nI enjoyed some of the quirks, but would've preferred a more traditional tuna melt and bloody mary or would at least have liked to be told otherwise.\n\nMeh.",

This was about 10 months ago. \n\nFast forward to last week, my wife and I decided to put a clear tint on my master bedroom French door windows that leads to our balcony. We wanted to do the Llumar Air 80 which we have on our front auto windshield. It is almost completely clear which should not affect our HOA as it is not reflective or dark in any way. Our main reason for wanting to do this  is for heat and UV rejection as those windows are facing west and a massive amount of heat comes into the room and whole house every afternoon til the evening hours. I remembered Brian did a standout job on our auto so I gave him a call. Surprisingly, he still remembered us and got us a quote very quickly with just the glass measurements. Made an appointment to get the job done and he was at my house bright and early the following Monday when I was available. \n\nYou can tell Brian loves what he does by watching the way he works. He started by trimming off all the excess glue around the window panes (glue has been there since day one when the house was built and the builders just left it like that). After that he covers the floors with plastic and sprayed soap and water on the glass and cleaned it all immaculately and carefully. If the tint was to come out perfectly he had to prep it well which he did spend a good amount of time doing. Finally the tint was put on, trimmed and bubbles squeegeed out. All in all it took a good couple of hours to do just two large windows but the results are fantastic! Room temperature was cooler almost immediately and we can really feel the difference! I'm sure this will help with our air conditioning and cooling costs but most importantly is our comfort level and with the curtains back and the blinds up, it just looks so great! \n\nThanks Brian for another wonderful job! I will definitely come back to you in the future for all our tinting needs!",

My hair looks like it does when I spend a quick 30 minutes blow drying out my curls myself. There was a miscommunication about what I wanted, I guess - I was asking for a \"classic blowout\" - and though the girl doing my hair was nice and tried to fix it, it was too late (my hair had dried in spots and the subsequent attempt to blow it out left it kinky, poofy, and frizzy). I wish she'd used their hair menu as I was just looking for the \"red carpet.\" I didn't realize the full extent of how bad it looks in the back until I took a closer look after leaving the location, or I would have complained on the spot. I am totally bummed I wasted $60 on this.",

The new building is beautiful and they are paying for it with increased food and drink prices! But if you are looking for a cool place to take the kids or your mother in law, this is it. On Wednesday's they have the qualifying for the rodeo. Friday night is the big show. The purse (winnings) must be some serious money because bull riders come from all over and up from Mexico. They have built more grandstand seating so you can sit all the way around the ring.\n\nSatellite bars are conveniently placed so you can get another beverage without having to go inside every time.\n\nIt's one of the coolest places to people watch as well. You have your Creekers - the artists, Cowboys, and Indians (and their dogs), you have the folks from Scottsdale, Desert Mountain and those who make the trek up from Phoenix, all smooshed together and having a great time.\n\nFood is ok. Smoked meat, grilled sausages, burgers. All a lot more expensive than it used to be. But a friendly staff.",

If you are going to get tofu then I would recommend offsetting the sweetness with a spicy sauce. \n\nTheir menu has quite a variety but does not have chicken or zucchini noodles as I have seen som other Poke restaurants have. The prices are comparable to other Poke bowls in Toronto at about $12-15. \n\nThe restaurant is quite small with a intimate dine in area. I'm guessing it's more popular for take out. \n\nI tried the ponzu sauce and truffle mayo for my bowl and it was very tasty",

I think there General Tso's is one of the best in the city and I could snack on their \"chips\" and duck sauce all day (and I almost have). \n\nThey have a bar inside as well, which is a less common, but welcomed addition to a chinese restaurant. My recommendation? General Tso's or Sesame Chicken every time.",

    "text": "Let me first off say that the place was very clean and the staff super friendly. Now onto the food we ordered the chicken pita, cup of fruit, chicken with rice, two sauces and potato salad. We sat around maybe 15 minutes and our food came. The chicken pita was so big that you couldn't close it they left a maybe half an inch thick tomato on it and the chicken wasn't shredded it was so big that the only way you could eat this is with a fork. The pita was kind of Dough-ie If that makes sense. They had a white sauce on there that was really good, I just wish I could have picked it up and ate it like a pita. As far as the chicken and rice, the rice has no flavor kind of tasted like that stuff you cook in the microwave in a pouch. The chicken was good a little bit chewy. The potato salad was OK. They have this green sauce (I wish I knew the names of the sauces I'm sorry) but that was really good mixed in with the chicken and the rice it made the meal better. I know this place is more like fast food but I was just thinking the flavors and the freshness was going to be better. If you're looking for something quick and filling this is it. If you're looking for a mediterranean flavor maybe try somewhere else.",

There are five tables inside the restaurant where you can eat or you can carry out. My favorite sandwich is corned beef and swiss on marble rye. Today I decided to get the combo:1/2 a sandwich plus a cup of clam chowder. You can make up your own sandwich or get one of the specialty sandwiches; and all sandwiches come with a crunchy pickle. For $2.25 you can can get double meat, but the sandwiches have plenty of meat on them. If you're looking for dessert, Oakmont Deli also sells gelato.",

I couldn't resist. \n\nI created the business listing while I was in line, waiting for it to be my turn. Was I in line for a ride at Disneyland or to get tacos? Its decor sort of reminded me of Frontierland at D-land, but the food was definitely better quality and price than that place. \n\nThe service was quick and to the point. The food was especially delicious, considering I fancy myself a connoisseur of quick service Mexican food. I don't think they do their meats/dairy as responsibly as Chipotle, but I could be wrong. I had never been to a Cafe Rio until yesterday, so it's all new and shiny to me.\n\nI did like how they put \"Tips to Not Get Fat Off Our Food\" in the bottom corner of the menu. (My words, not theirs, but that's definitely what they're meaning to say.) In case you don't know, you can save food for later and not eat it in one setting. OMG GUYS, did you know that??? Did you know that you don't have to eat all the food at once? Cafe Rio definitely makes it easier, as they put lids out to make everything a to-go box if you want.\n\nI will definitely be back to try out the different things on the menu, but a single taco with rice and beans was enough (and yes, I did take some of it home).",

First, we felt out of place because this place is fancier than the name suggests: hostesses in very nice dresses, dj, bartender, etc. Then, we were shocked by the prices. Maybe there should be another way to rate prices for breakfast places, but paying $12-$15 a plate for breakfast is more than we expected for eggs benedict or a hash dish. Although the food was fairly good, it just wasn't as mind-blowingly good as I had heard it would be or as I would hope it would be for the price. Overall, I have to say that the service was great. The servers and hostesses were attentive and helpful. Everyone around me seemed to be enjoying their meals. This place just wasn't for me.",

Arrowhead- Closest one to us, but ALWAYS a clusterfuck!\nC. Avondale- Close, but had never been, so it would be the first time at this one.\n\nWe went with Avondale and I was glad we did!\n\nWe got there pretty early after opening which was nice.  We got a parking spot right next to the entrance, and had free roam throughout the store before the crowds started to pile up.  If you have been to any Costco, you know the type of stuff they carry.  We picked up our usual supplies, and were in and out within about 30 minutes.  Greeter at the door was incredibly friendly, as well as the boxer/cashier.  I can't remember a time where I had a less stress free experience at Costco.  It could have been due to how early it was, but whatever, it was a great trip!  I think I will be using this one in the future when the family has to make a run. (Will still use the Deer Valley one if I need an item or two..its 2 minutes from work).\n\nI love Costco and had a great time here today at the Avondale location!  I'll be back, for sure!",

The truffle fries are magical, especially with the dipping sauce.  I have only had milkshake, but it was creamy, thick, and chocolately.  I like the idea of being able to have wine or beer or a milkshake or all three with a burger.  I love the bar, which is massive and has both indoor and outdoor seating.  I also enjoy the giant pasture painted on the wall with the signature cows.  My gripe with Zinburger is, of course, it is pricey.  To get a milkshake, burger, and fries, you are looking at spending $25 and that's without tip.  Yikes.  Now if you come with a friend or date, you can split shakes and fries to make the price less sticker shock.  Zinburger is definitely one of the few restaurants that makes me wish I had a sugar daddy.",

When I gave him a dollar for a hard way bet, he kept it. It never went on the double 5's I asked for. Maybe he's sexist and didn't believe I knew how to play the game? (You know, cuz I'm a woman. So obvi I don't know how to play craps.) \n\n2. I had a come bet, which got moved to the six. When the six did get rolled (BEFORE the shooter rolled 7,) he paid out the DUDE BESIDE ME. YES, I know I should have said something in the moment, but that often gets you no where while gambling. So I just quietly took the money I DID win and left. The second that shooter rolled a seven, I left. And I will surely gamble somewhere less sexist next time. (It wasn't Grant! He was nice.

The food made it easy for us to do it though. Our waiter spoke Cantonese so it was great because my mom and grandmother barely speak English. It was a fusion restaurant so a bit of the familiar mixed with unfamiliar made for a great experience.\n\nIt's quite a small restaurant with not a lot of seating. Some may feel it's cramped but it wasn't a big deal.\n\nWe pretty much ordered half the menu. I order all 3 steamed mantou sandwiches, pork jowl skewers, confit duck wings, tea smoked duck breast, torched mackerel, fried chicken and lamb ribs.\n\nOut of the 3 sandwiches, I'd have to say that the brisket and pork belly were on par with one another and the chicken one was just alright. The former two were very flavorful. Each basket comes with two sandwiches.\n\nI think I enjoyed the pork jowl skewers the most. Just the right amount of fat for the tenderness plus it was both sweet and spicy on top of that.\n\nI thought the duck wings were okay. I'm used to trying the duck wings from the local grocery store and they didn't taste that much different. Not sure if I'd order it again or if I got good value.\n\nWhen it came to the duck breast, it didn't seem that different from the smoked duck breast that you get from the store. It just might seem like a thing regarding duck at this point. This was the most expensive thing on the menu so I expected a bit more.\n\nThe torched mackerel was worth it. It was tangy as most mackerel are and we spent a lot of time eating it. They said it was boneless but I found a bone here and there so be careful.\n\nI don't really remember how the lamb ribs were so... I'm just going to say forgettable. Might have to order it again to see if they actually were.\n\nThe fried chicken here was awesome. They gave us a lot and it was extremely crunchy. It was good by itself but even better with the hot sauce. The kimchi was a bit random but I like kimchi.\n\nMy brother and grandma enjoyed it but my mom loved it. She was so busy eating, she didn't even have time to talk. I think the bill came up to $150 for the 4 of us. So, it was a bit on the pricey side but I'd still come back after saving a little or maybe I just won't order too many expensive items.",

    "text": "Worst experience EVER.  My mom and myself brought my sister in because she was still feeling awful from what her primary had diagnosed as strep throat.  The antibiotics weren't helping and we thought it may be walking pneumonia.  As soon as we got in, the concierge who seemed to lack any type of enthusiasm at all got her in the system and my sister and I were directed to the next counter to get a bracelet.  Only about 10 minutes go by before she is taken back and poked and prodded.  The doctor didn't say hello to my mom or myself at all, although the nurses were friendly.  We tried to explain that she may have pneumonia but he quickly dismissed us.  My sister can be rather flustered in this type of situation so we tried to help explain, but since she is 18, they wanted nothing to do with what we had to say.  They did not to an X-ray which startled the nurse who came back with her results later, but more on that down the line.  \n\nAfter her insurance was recorded into the system, we were hurried back out into the waiting room where a few more people had populated.  My family and I were making conversation when we noticed a couple other patients complaining about the wait, which they had been told would be a few minutes, that turned into an hour or more.  One woman white, one black *It's important to know this, trust me*.  The black woman, who we learned was named Jasmine, found she was being charged for a room that she was never in.  She asked the nurse politely to speak to someone, as well as what was taking so long.  This prompted the white woman to also ask about what had taken so long seeing as her son was ill enough and like anyone in an ER setting, they wanted to get the hell out of there.  The nurse was very rude to both of them and was getting smart, so the black woman (Jasmine) asked for her name and the nurse covered her badge, but Jasmine thinking quickly, already saw it, and immediately asked for a social worker.  The social worker came out and spoke with the white woman but not to Jasmine, completely ignoring her, and worst of all, as soon as Jasmine spoke up for her right to speak to someone, with zero attitude, they called security to stand nearby just in case.\n\nWhile Jasmine waited, the security guard whom I had a bad feeling about, was talking major smack about Jasmine to another patient.  Completely unprofessional right off the bat.  The nurse who refused to give her name was offering blankets to people in the waiting room, all except Jasmine.  PURE RACISM!!!!!\n\nEventually, my sister was taken back and given her results which were mild to say the least.  The doctor had recommended that she stop her antibiotics, which is stupid.  I come from a medical background and never once has anyone thought it was a good idea to stop your AB's before they are finished.  As we turned to leave we saw Jasmine crying in a corner with what I assumed was another doctor.  Jasmine ran up to my mom and said that the staff had called the cops on her and planned to have her trespassed.  My mom stayed behind because Jasmine was scared.  My sister and I went to get food and of course, by now I'm infuriated.  Under my breath, and directed toward my sister, I said \"piece of shit security guards\", which caught the ear of one of them.  He shouted at me as I rounded the corner out of the door.  As I exited, he came up to me, now mind you we are outside of his jurisdiction at this point as I was obviously leaving and not looking for a fight.  He came 2 inches from my face, cursing at me and telling me that he will have me trespassed.  I continued to say \"yes sir\" just to get him out of my face.  He went on about how there were sick people in this building, one of them being my sister who he was scaring the shit out of at the moment.  I walked away and returned with food for my family.  My sister was so anxiety ridden she couldn't function until she got to see my mom.  She had the idea in her head that the security guard would hurt her after his little display with me.  As soon as I told my mom what had happened, she lost her shit and asked for his name.  Needless to say, they claimed not to know his name and refused to give it up but said that my mom could pick up the red security phone and ask the security department for his name.  When she did so, the phone was silent on the other end and they refused to give his name up also. \n\n We left and will not be back.  A police report was filed by me and my sister due to the incident with the security guard.",

I had choppy and chunky layers instead of feathering or texturing, meaning when the cut finally grew out, it looked heavy and helmet like. I went to Thorps after reading other yelp reviews and booked an appointment with Bria. \n\nI was super excited when I met her to see that she also had an adorable short cut and knew exactly what to do with my hair. The place had a wonderful vibe, super welcoming and comfortable. Bria was amazing. She shaped and texturized my cut into something really stylish and cute that framed my face perfectly. (And recommended some great restaurants for a new 30ish person in Madison!) \n\nI am definitely going back and cannot recommend it enough!",

It looks like I'll be finding a new Asian Fusion spot...\n\nThe Man and I had a couple hours to kill and hungry bellies to feed, so we popped into Flo's for their (seemingly) amazing happy hour.  I ordered a froo-froo drink, which I'm pretty sure was half-price because it contained half the alcohol it normally does.  Tasty, but strong? Um, no.  We moved on to a bunch of appetizers: crab puffs, chicken satay, spring rolls, BBQ pork, and pot stickers.  The BBQ pork was yummy, but that is where our satisfaction ended.  All of the other items seemed no better than from-the-freezer snacks I can get at the grocery store.  Are they making any of these on site?  Maybe, but it sure didn't taste like it.  The crab puffs were the most disappointing.  So little crab, so much cream cheese.  They should definitely take a look at that ratio and either rename the dish or up the crab quantity.  Just a thought...\n\nNow I'm off on a journey for a new go-to Asian spot!",

And I will reiterate, just start calling this location, \"Walmart\"...because it is very clear that the employees and management team cannot hold up to what Target's standards are supposed to be. \n\nI avoid this Target at all costs if need be, you can smell the bathrooms that are located in the front of the store all the way in the back of the store. It's dirty, it's unorganized. I've said enough.\n\nI'm re-writing this review because of the experience I had yesterday evening with an associate, Carlo. \n\nYesterday evening I brought my son (who is 18 months old) in for a quick errand. We stopped by the bargain section and I let him pick out a sippy cup.\n\nAt checkout, I was speaking to the cashier (Carlo) about a price check - which he already had an attitude with me. \n\nBefore I continue let me just point out that I am pretty well mannered, I have my child under control and I'm a normal person, not doing anything to deserve this attitude. \n\nWhile speaking with Carlo, my son, WHO IS 18 MONTHS. Is trying to hand him the sippy cup to scan it, he's not screaming or crying or tempering, just reaching the cup towards him that doesn't even reach up half way to his chest. \n\nMid-conversation, Carlo grabs my son's wrist and yanks the sippy cup out of his hand like he was holding a firework and did something wrong.\n\nAdmittedly, I have never had something like this happen with my son. Ever. So I didn't even react, I was just in shock. He didn't say anything, scoffed at me, didn't thank me at the end, say have a nice night, nothing.\n\nI left the store embarrassed and in shock thinking I did something wrong as a parent. I considered calling management but thought I was overreacting. Took some time to really think of it and thought, in no way was it moral of this employee to put his hand on my son like that. Even if he was being a brat (which let me remind you, he wasn't). That's not your kid, that's not your job. YOU DON'T PUT YOUR HAND ON A CUSTOMER'S CHILD FORCEFULLY. \n\n\nI contacted the store after thinking and was unable to get a hold of a manager. Shocker. \n\nThat was it for me, never coming to this Walmart again. And I hope I never see Carlo out of his place of employment. \n\n\n:(",

I don't think bartenders make drinks that fast on New Years....slow down cowboy. It was so comforting to watch him never wash his hands. He also placed the clean rack of dished right in front of us. Very rude and inconsiderate \"bar tender\". \n\nOur food came quick and it was good. No one ever came to ask us how the food was which was disappointing because I needed more ketchup. The bar had 4 people working and not one of them showed any interest in receiving a good tip. The restaurant manager was behind the bar at one point and didn't bother to ask how our meal was.

This time, we got xiao long bao/soup dumplings, an egg/onion pancake thing, rice roll thing, spicy tofu, regular dumplings, and a bun that you dip into condensed milk. For the most part I liked everything except I could have done without the spicy tofu. The bun with condensed milk was really good, but so simple, it's like something you can just make at home yourself. Whatever they put into their dumplings was seriously addictive like crack though, like I couldn't stop eating them and just thinking about them now is making me salivate.

Anyhow, I didn't ask them where they got their fish from. However, by the look, smell, and taste of the sushi, I cant tell it is fresh. The quality of fish is SUPERB! \n\nAlso I overheard the sushi chef tell the story of his life. He's from Japan, lived in New York and had a sushi restaurant, moved to Pittsburgh, owned a Japanese grocery store in Shadyside, then opened up Kiku. While watching him make sushi, I noticed him using gloves AND washing his hands!!! I mean I've never seen that before but my inner-nurse was jumping for joy! \n\nI love that this place is authentic and quaint! There's none of that \"goop\" slathered on rolls, there's nothing wrong with that. But if you are looking for something more traditional. Kiku is definitely a hidden treasure.\n\nWhat I loved: \n1. Miso soup - one word can describe it. UMAMI!!\n2. Kagoshima - because I love yellowtail\n3. Temaki Spicy tuna \n4. Nigiri Toro\n5. TOMAGO!!! - slightly sweet and well made. One of the Best!\n\nArigato gozaimasu!",

    "text": "Debated a long time yesterday how many stars to give Blackstone, but after today's discussion with my family where we again complained about the faults of yesterday's dinner, I decided that two stars was the right rating. This was due to two reasons: the poor cuts of beef and the bad managerial decision.\n\nSteak:\nWe ordered one of each steak cut: the tenderloin, sirloin, and the rib eye. The 8oz tenderloin was well executed and the highlight of the night. The cut was tender and juicy. However, it went downhill from there. The sirloin and the rib eye were far too tough and chewy. There were literal pieces of tendon dispersed throughout the cut, which made chewing very difficult. It wasn't particularly flavourful either. The steaks were impressive merely due to the lava stones upon which they were served; they were otherwise a disappointment. \nMy dad also ordered the lamb shank, a pitiful piece of mush that came drowning in an overly sickening sweet BBQ sauce. There was absolutely no flavour whatsoever; it was an overdone, overbraised lamb. That said, I suppose we were at fault for ordering something other than steak at a steakhouse.\n\nService:\nWe came to celebrate my sister's birthday; I had called in advance to let then know and asked whether there would be any dessert or celebration. The manager had mentioned that they could bring a cake with a birthday song and decorate it nicely - just to let him know upon arrival. I did just that, but decided to confirm whether the celebration would be on the house. He said that it wouldn't be, which is totally fine, so I told him that I'd reconsider and let him know later. Halfway during the meal, he walks by with a pat on my shoulder, assuring me that he \"will take care of it\". From that, I assumed that he decided to provide the cake on the house, and was delighted. You can imagine my shock when I see the $8 charge on the bill at the end! While the celebration was a nice gesture, I never explicitly asked for it. That was because I didn't feel that a measly small piece of cake was worth $8, no matter how good. For him to make a decision on my behalf - the customer's behalf - is simply unacceptable.\nThe servers, though friendly, had difficulties understanding our order. The sides for the steak were switched, so we had to go through the trouble of righting their mistakes. Moreover, they just kept checking in on us, which almost felt as if they were breathing down our necks a bit. It was slightly pushy and overwhelming. \nFinally, the table space was very tight. There was simply insufficient room for all the plates and stones. However, despite our raising of this point, they simply dismissed it. The cramped table simple made dining there uncomfortable.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you're craving a good steak, I would not choose this place. If you're interested in the experience of the lava stone, then sure, come and try. I won't come again only because I feel that we were ripped off with the sudden charge and delivery of the birthday cake.",

    "text": "I recently stayed here, not even a week ago, and it was less than okay, and I'll explain why...\n\n1) This hotel is not located on the strip, initially I knew that, but my boyfriend was dying to stay here so I compromised, knowing that there'd be a shuttle plus he said we'd just take cabs seeing as though it was only a mile from the strip. Come to find out the shuttle ran every half hour which is horrible, & only sat 12 ppl so if you were the 13th you would have to wait until the next one came which was a whole half an hour later AND it stopped running at 8 so if you wanted to leave your hotel after 8 or come back from the strip to your hotel after 8 that's a 12 dollar cab with cash, 15 with a card (for a mile long ride!). You can see how hanging out after 8 outside of your hotel can add up in cab fees if there's only 2 of you like it was for me.\n\n2) When checking in there were only two receptionists and they moved pretty damn slow. We checked in, I want to say around 11pm, which is probably why there were only two staff but it's a hotel, it's Vegas, people are checking in all the time, so the wait for that was a little ridiculous.\n\n3) The wifi was Blahhh, it was very slow and I had to enter my name and room number constantly to keep connecting back to it... Annoying!\n\n4) The food wasn't cheap at all, it was 45 bucks for my boyfriend and I to eat at the buffet which I thought would have been fitting for two ppl that didn't stay in the hotel opposed to two ppl that did BUT I will say that they served endless champagne which diffused the situation for me, they did good with that (finally!)\n\n5) There was a $20 fee a night so when I was checking out that was $80 for me but they attempted to charge us for a Gatorade and some other item that we never used which hiked up the price. After we told them we hadn't used anything in the mini bar they did take those items off of the bill. Twenty dollars a night is still kind of ridiculous after paying hundreds of dollars for the hotel room already, don't you think?\n\n6) At this point I'm done talking about this place! There are already too many deterring points I've made about this hotel that I just do not feel like continuing. On the ups the room was nice and newly renovated and we had two beds when we only needed one, the bathroom was really nice and the tv had cable so good job on that I guess. We were able to do one party at the \"Moon something\" for free after putting ourselves on the guest list. The party itself was a little corny but the rooftop view was pretty cool.\n\n7) All in all if you MUST stay here it won't be your worst experience, especially if you're richer than me, lol, but I would recommend staying somewhere on the strip, it's much more convenient, some of the hotels are less expensive, and you won't have to worry about carfare after 8pm! I, however, would NEVER stay here again!",

    "text": "This place is nothing more than a dream come true for fans of well cooked meats and foie gras!  Despite the small walk-through space and single bathroom, you can't go wrong with the tinted lighting, wood and brick walls, and open kitchen concept, making for a very welcoming dining atmosphere.\n\nThe food is slightly on the pricey side, with an average dish ranging from $25-37 depending on what you order. But the portions are well worth every dollar. One dish is enough to satisfy a big eater; two dishes will induce food coma. And when you're dealing with meats slow cooked to perfection, marinated with simple yet delicious flavours, and well complimenting sides, it can get very easy to get carried away with wanting to try everything.\n\nI sat down with five other friends, all of us guys and in Montreal for a bachelor party (attention bachelor party planners, this is the perfect place for dinner). They sat us near the open window, which for a warm evening was great. It gave us room to breathe and a good view of the restaurant or of the street depending on where we looked.\n\nAfter a round of beers, we shared a Boudin Tart and a Duck Carpaccio. The tart crust was light and crispy topped with caramel onion, potato, and blood sausage cooked to perfection. The foie gras drizzle on top made for a light but wonderfully complex marriage of flavours and the dish was shared evenly among us. The Duck Carpaccio went as quickly as it appeared. The thinly sliced pieces of raw duck signified meat of the highest quality and flavour, and it was balanced out with an egg yolk, olive oil, mushrooms, capers, and mushrooms.\n\nThe main dishes were equally spectacular. The PDC cut was a roast so big, it had to share it. It was cooked very well. A crispy flavourful exterior with a well done first layer down to a juicy medium rare interior. The veal rib was a massive, single rib with melt off the bone, tender, and astoundingly seasoned meat. My duck magret in mushroom sauce was absolutely spectacular. The sauce was a light white wine flavouring, thinly sliced mushrooms covering thin slices of duck cooked medium rare. With each slice, the flavour of the duck became more noticeable.\n\nDessert was light, since by this point we were all stuffed. I ordered a maple toffee milkshake. It wasn't big; served in the same glass as our beer. It was a frothy shake, not thick, but it also had a light, non-invasive sweetness. The toffee flavour came from a thick piece of toffee that sat in the shake and could be eaten at any time. It was a satisfying end to a satisfying meal.\n\nThe star lost was mainly due to the poor service we got from the main waitress. The bus boy was fantastic. He promptly refilled our water and got us more bread than we could stomach. The runner was equally pleasant. But the main waitress had a bit of attitude from her greeting, was not helpful in any way, and never came back to check on us. If it weren't for her assisted helpers, we would have had no interaction with any staff. Also, we were warned that the PDC cut would take 50 minutes to prepare, but after an hour of waiting, no one came with an update. I can see how this would have turned off tourists from recommending the place, or from wrecking the dining experience.\n\nHowever, Au Pied de Cochon has quickly become a go to place whenever I'm in Montreal. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and when you talk about value, I wouldn't have been angry if the prices were even higher than they are considering the quality. I highly recommend this place!",

I browsed again today (The penultimate day before closing their doors for good), looking through their impressive variety of new, popular, older/classic, and obscure films (The obscure videos are the best!). Browsing by aisle is definitely an experience that many people these days will unfortunately miss out on. Sometimes there is more fun in the act of browsing than watching the movie you pick out. :)\n\nCurrently they have deeply discounted Blu-Ray, DVDs, and games. Prices are as low as $1.99 for case-less DVDs and box sets are $9.99.",

The server, though friendly and attentive, was pretty clueless.  I told her that our daughter had a peanut allergy and if I could see the food allergy menu.  She had no idea what I was talking about.  When we asked if there were any items that have peanuts in them or were cooked with peanut sauce or peanut oil, she said the hummus.  While it sounded strange, we didn't say anything at the moment.  Later when she brought our food, I asked if the hummus was really made with peanuts or maybe she meant chickpeas?   She said she had to ask the kitchen and get back to us.  Overall, our food was okay, but nothing great.  As food allergies are becoming more common and some are potentially life threatening, such as a severe peanut allergy, I think it's important that the staff is more knowledgeable and better prepared to handle questions about their menu.",

They have great deals and offers and got a really good deal with one night for free which extended my vacation. Upon arriving at the Vdara, the experience was remarkable. As soon as you walk into the lobby, you automatically get this great feel of classiness and cleanliness all over. A very slick and sexy hotel no doubt, great for everyone. Even though the Vdara has no casino, its actually a great benefit. Nice and quiet, great for relaxing and if you're ready to gamble, the Cosmopolitan and the Aria are literally feet away. Another benefit of the Vdara is that you have the tram station at your hotel which leads you to the Aria and Monte Carlo, very very convenient and nice ride too, you get a great view of the City Center that you cant get without getting on the tram. The rooms are amazing, very modern and classy as well. I also had a great view of the Bellagio fountains and the Cosmo, nothing better than waking up watching the show. The curtains as well are automatic, which is very cool as well. The bathroom is unbelievable and overall this place surpassed my expectations. I 100% recommend staying here, don't pass it up!",

The sushi and prepared food items are really fresh and made with care, large salad bar and made-to-order stir-fry station are great additions to a great store. The product selection is vast for a medium-size grocery store and the people in the deli, fish and meat departments are super friendly and helpful. I've always had a good experience with Heinen's and I would recommend anyone in the area to stop in a check out their bakery and meat department. There is a large selection of organic produce, artisan cheeses and a whole section of vegan foods. The prices are pretty good considering the high quality of store-brand products and the there are sales on both store-brand and name-brand items.",

    "text": "As you might guess from the name Chez Ma Grosse Truie Cherie is not the best place to bring a vegetarian for supper.  For those of you unfamiliar with the word, truie means sow in French so the name refers to a fat female pig.  The menu is true to its name so there are plenty of pork-inspired dishes here.\n\nThe restaurant looks very simple and unassuming from the outside.  Once inside though it feels elegant and intimate.  It is also quite large inside so there is plenty of seating to be had.  They also have a terrasse that looks like it would be a nice place to sit in warmer months.\n\nWhile there are some non-pork based dishes like beef tartare and duck I thought it best to see if the restaurant does a good job with pork products.  That meant that I ordered the tomahawk, which was a pork chop garnished with apple sauce and served with a sweet potato puree.  I enjoyed the flavours of the dish but I felt that the meat was a little overdone as it was on the tough and chewy side.  The portion was pretty big so I'm glad I skipped the appetizer since that would have been overkill.  I also tried a mouthful of my friend's ribs which were really tender.\n\nDessert was a brownie served with caramel bacon ice cream.  The ice cream was really good and I liked how the salty and sweet balanced each other out.  The tiny chunks of bacon also added a nice touch.  The brownie on the other hand was rock hard and impossible to eat with the spoon they gave me.  It was really dense and chocolatey so that was what seemed to give it that hard texture but I would have traded some of that for something that was softer and easier to eat.\n\nThe service was great.  Our server seemed to know the menu inside and out and he did a great job with recommendations.  Everything arrived in a timely fashion and he did check on us regularly to see how we were doing.\n\nPrices were okay but I felt that since my dishes weren't the greatest they could have been better.  I think the restaurant definitely has potential but it does need to work on its execution a bit.  The experience as a whole was just okay.  Nothing awful but nothing excellent either.",

The pool is lovely, although a bit chilly this time of year. The street walk (inside) really does remind me of Paris, although the prices are too high. I was looking for quality croissants or French rolls, and didn't find them, sadly. \n\nWith the upgrade we got continental breakfast and drinks and \"appetizers\" at night. We felt that was a great bargain because the night food became our dinner. And two drinks apiece per night was plenty. The breakfast was plenty, too, with yogurt, fruit and cheese, bagels and lox, and so on. Much more than \"continental\" suggests.\n\nThe worst thing about the Paris is the Frankie Valli music in the elevators--yuck! After listening to that ad nauseum, I would never see \"Jersey Boys.\"\n\nThe second worst is the loud, pounding music that hit our room until 4:30 am (!), and we were on the 21st floor (!!!). My husband called to complain, and he was told the hotel's president made the decision to allow the loud booming until 4:30. For that reason, we could not stay here again. While I sleep like a rock, my husband couldn't sleep.",

We didn't want to wait any longer so luckily we found another spot on the street. The interior of this place is breath taking and I really did appreciate the level of detail that went into building this place. The food was excellent nonetheless; however, portions are very small. I can't attest to all of their dishes being this way, but what my mother and I ordered was small. I left the restaurant still hungry. The flavor of my dish was incredible though and I could have ate more of it no doubt! My dish was the short rib yaki noodles ($16)! My mom ordered the scallop pad thai ($19) which she also really enjoyed but also agreed more noodles would have been nice. I would like to come back for a late dinner and drinks. Maybe try out their sushi options or even the ramen.",

It would be a perfect place to meet with friends for some drinks or for a business meeting. You can either sit inside in one of the different rooms they have or you can sit outside with a view of the pool. \n\nAll the employees I interacted with were very pleasant and respectful. I had the turkey club and my boyfriend had the Madame Croque. Both were absolutely amazing. I added a friend egg to my sandwich which made it even better in my opinion. \n\nEven the fries were really good. The turkey was fresh and the dijonaisse really added a good flavor. Everything is seasoned generously but I like seasoning but I can see how someone can think it's too much. \n\nThe madame croque was out of this world. It's brioche bread with ham and gruyere cheese, a Parmesan crust on the brioche and an over easy egg on top. So simple but so good. It comes with a small side of brown mustard I believe and a couple mini pickles. I highly recommend this dish. \n\nAll in all great atmosphere, great service, great food. I will definitely be back when I am in Vegas again.",

I ended up being super disappointed in their selection and they have not updated their site in awhile apparently. Style Encore was honestly more beat up than Plato's Closet. They accepted a ton of faded and cheap fashion from places like Forever 21 and other no name brands and their assortment was awful as a result. This store is geared toward teens who dress casual and wear leggings and athletic tops. I never saw so many pairs of faded overpriced leggings and dirty boots. I was expecting high end dresses, blouses, and pants from WHBM, Arden B, Express, Ann Taylor, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, etc. But it was all junk and I feel bad for the owner because it looks like Goodwill in there. I do not see them staying in business much longer and hope they update their website so others do not waste their time like I did. The employees were nice is the only positive thing I have to say.",

    "text": "This sandwich and rugulach habit is getting ridiculous. The BF and I have come back several times in such a short span. \n\nThe first few times we got breakfast and I highly recommend for eggs benedict fans to get it here. I love hollandaise and they are not skimpy with it, ham actually has flavor, perfect poach eggs. I tried the crab cake version too, and surprised I liked the original better. The corned beef hash was another we tried and I thought it was tasty. I love their potatoes the brekkies come with and the bagels of their name sake actually are quite nice. \n\nThen I decided to try their corned beef sandwich and was prepared to be only mildly satisfied. I have a little Jewish corner of my heart that beats for childhood Saturdays at Langer's. The corned beef was flavorful, juicy and the marbled bread I chose was great. I always eat mine with  coleslaw and Russian dressing (aka thousand island). I'm normally into pickles, but theirs is closer to cucumber than pickle so I'm not the most fond of it. The sandwich was so good, I was a bit sad to  share with the BF and take the other half of the benedict even though I love the bennie. \n\nSo we came back several more times to get our own. I have to say that the way to go is the soup and half sandwich deal ($10.95- $11.95). It actually comes out cheaper with more food since the sandwich was just as big as a 1/4th lb, you get soup and can even get a side if you wish for $1. The matzo ball soup here is decent, and the sweet and sour stuffed cabbage was nice though I dropped my phone in it trying to Yelp it. We also tried the lobster salad sandwich and that was solid, but I'm gonna stay with the meat sandwiches..... I should mention I lean towards mostly eating vegetarian and this place is testing it. \n\nService is pretty decent on checking up. We also don't go during busy times as this is the type of place that gets swamped during regular breakfast/lunch hours on weekends. Beat the busy by heading in a bit later in the afternoon. \n\nWhile the sandwich and benedict have been stellar, the dessert counter has been extreme highs and lows so much so that I can't justify a 5star. \n\nThe best: The rugulach are awesomely good. I normally don't like chocolate ones but I love them here, the almond ones are great, all the fruit ones are great. There is not a bad one so even though it is priced per pound, I feel this is worth it. \nThe subpar: I'm not fond of the black and white cookie being more like cake. I know a lot of delis do this and I'm just more of a shadortbred person.  The rainbow cookies were okay, but not quite up to my standard with it being too wet though the sponge flavor was right on (those are one of my favorite deli sweets). The homemade twinkie was a bit dry.\n The bad: we got a slice of buttercream cake which was painfully sweet with the frosting tasting like boxed. It was thick, sticky and you can feel sugar granules in it with the cake itself also rather sweet. It was a throwaway so I will not be getting anything else but rugulachs. The desserts aren't cheap for what they are...Spent $27 with only the rugulachs being the only thing we are gonna eat the entirety of. \n\nThis is great place and I do highly recommend this as a go-to if you're in the area, just know how to navigate the deli and massive menu through recommendations.",

The sea salt grotto with its warm seats, salt air, and mood lighting is the best way to end the treatment. \n\nYou also have access to the fitness center and I just found out that you can take one of the fitness classes for free as well (when booked for a service) including cardio, dance, and yoga. I wish i knew that one sooner!",

We relaxed, ate and drank and when we felt like cooling down we floated on our tubes in the lazy river. Best way to spend the day.  The service was great as well and worth the reserved cabana pod price.",

We arrived, checked into our hotel, took a nap and then went out to eat... yeah I know... we're old!\n\nI saw the pics and reviews of this place and book marked it before I even arrived in Vegas =)\n\nAt about 9:30 am we had about a 20 min wait. Once seated our server seemed a bit frazzled and overly busy so everything, including our food and drinks seemed to arrive a bit late. \n\nWe ended up ordering a veggie hash with scrambled eggs and fruit on the side. It was pretty darn good and the eggs were cooked perfectly. \n\nNext time I think I'll opt for a giant pancake or sandwich. Keep in mind that the portions are huge so if you aren't super hungry its a good idea to share a meal. \n\nI'll come back again for breakfast/brunch the next time I'm in Vegas.",

However the food is great and the people are real and can see they appreciate you eating there.\n\nI don't know if the guy at the door is the owner or not, I am assuming so as he seems to be the heart and soul of the operation. He was friendly, talkative and made you feel like part of the family and he appreciated you being there. \n\nYou could see the food being made and the whole kitchen staff. The kitchen staff reminded me of gents fresh out of the pen, however they worked hard, looked like they appreciated having a job, looked like they just belonged. I was thankful to them and thought they kicked butt. \n\nI come to Vegas 3-5 times a year from S. California. If I am alone then no doubt I go to Mr. Mamas at least 1 time for breakfast while I am there. If I can I work to talk friends into coming with me to Mr. Mamas. \n\nMy favorite is the Chili Omelet. The Chili is amazing. I love it. I am sure that the chili is homemade and fresh because it is so good. If they ever tell me that it is canned then my heart will be broken. LOL",

For the location (rooftop) and view (all of State Street and the Capitol), Fresco gets a five-- it's perhaps the best in those two categories in the city.\nHowever, with what they DO with that amazing space, they get them a 2 or 3. With the fantastic rooftop location and outdoor patio space, they should have more outdoor furniture, a cocktail bar, and a lounge-esque DJ/music set-up EVERY night in the summer (at least on weekend nights). It's really such a shame.\nStill, the food is excellent (if not a tad pretentious) and the cocktail menu is nice. They have a fantastic happy hour deal in the summer (Fresco Fives) and they also have a late night-ish cheaper dinner menu sometimes.\nWhile there's really a lot of room for improvement, the location on the top of the art museum and the high quality food and drink still earns them a solid 4.",

I went here for a quick staycation over the weekend for my anniversary and I couldn't ask for anything more special. The beauty of the resort and the service I received from every single staff member was Incredible! \n\nCheck in is normally at 4pm but I called that morning and the staff was very kind over the phone and found an available room so we were able to check-in at 12pm. All parking is valet so you pull up, and the bell hops will help unload your car and direct you to check in desk. The staff was so nice checking us in and then even greeted us with a fresh glass of champagne. Our bell hop walked us to our room and even explained a little history about the resort. Like it used to be a home in 1922. \n\nThe rooms are large and beautiful. We had a huge soaker tub and a large double shower head walk in shower. We also had a free Keurig in the room and a private patio. My favorite part was the bed! It was so fluffy and felt like a cloud! Best sleep of my life! They do a turn down service at night so they come in and turn down bed sheets, give chocolates, and close the curtains so your ready for bed. We received a gift of chocolate covered strawberries and champagne for our anniversary when we got back to the room. Such a romantic evening. \n\nThis is a very beautiful historic Spanish style resort so very little kids which is nice for a special romantic occasion. There is multiple courtyards that all look different so it's gorgeous to just walk all the pathways and explore. Beautiful lit up at night. There is benches, tables, games, waterfalls, and fruit trees all over the property. Great large pool and jacuzzi which is open 24-7 so you can go anytime at night when it's less busy. They do have a great poolside bar and it's pretty packed during the day. \n\nCheck-out was at 12pm but they are very accommodating so just a quick call down to front office they let us know we can check out at 1pm which allowed us more time to relax in the morning. We ordered breakfast in bed of pancakes and a fried egg sandwich which were both amazing! \n\nOverall everything from start to finish was amazing. Such a beautiful resort to stay at for a romantic evening and the staff made our stay so special. I'm very excited to come back, if not sooner, at least for our anniversary next year. Next time I want to try the famous T Cooks restaurant on property that I herd great things from. \n\nThank you Hyatt and royal palms for making our anniversary so special!",

It was a bit intimidating at first since they were all just waiting for me to place an order. But I could imagine there being a nice assembly system once the shop gets busy in peak hours.  I got a bit indecisive after checking out their menu. They offer prefixed items (some with ice creams, some without) and customized option in which you can build your own by adding toppings for a cost. It took me a bit of time to decide which option to go for but I ended up building my own with a cappuccino waffle base with a scoop of sesame seed ice cream drizzled with chocolate Syrup and sprinkled with icing sugar. Price came to about $8. I originally wanted to try their milk tea waffle but it was unavailable at the time. I was surprised to find their cappuccino waffle to actually taste like coffee. The base was crispy and aromatic with strong coffee flavour in every bite. The sesame ice cream is decent, not really packed with intense sesame flavour but the flavour was there. I'd actually prefer the ice cream to be more flavorful but in my case since the cappuccino waffle was so strong already, the ice cream created a good balance.\n\nOverall, I think I had a great experience and I'd come back to try other flavors when I'm in the area.",

The care and attention to detail he puts into every aspect of the food drastically breaks through with such intense and immensely delicious flavors! I wish I could give this review more than five stars! I will definitely be frequenting this restaurant many times!",

The potatoes are good and they were GREAT 20 years ago-with the right combo of parsley, cabbage, and onion. Somehow the flavor has changed maybe due to recipe changes. It's been 3 years and I will be returning in another month to see what's changed and will update my review accordingly. Service has never been a problem however perhaps the economy has taken it's toll on the ingredients. Can't speak for the drinks - have not ordered any there.",

The muffins are good but my favorite would be the Eclairs.  Though they used to replace them every day and I'm not sure that's still the case.\n\nIt's not the best coffee I've ever had.

    "text": "So we headed to Cibo after a night downtown going to a special event, followed by a movie- then dinner! The good: it was Sat. night and the wait wasn't too long. The pizza and pear salad we ordered was awesome. \nThe downside, my fiance ordered the \"calzone pizza\" you can see that this is listed for yourself under the pizza section here: http://www.cibophoenix.com/cena.pdf. Across from it you see the \"Crostone\" which is described as being a calzone. You can see where this is going. They served up a calzone. We asked a gentleman working there about it- he was clueless as to what might even be on the menu- and then made us feel crazy. Then the waitress came over and we asked her and she said that both of those menu items are calzones. Which is strange since one is described as a calzone- they other as an actual pizza. \nShe said this happens \"all the time.\" \nThat's fine but either change your menu, or let someone know when they are ordering it that they are NOT ordering a pizza. I will also say that the pecorino cheese on the pear salad is cut so thick that in the candle light it looked like jicama. The service continues to be bad, we waited time and time again for water, they never asked if we wanted to order more wine, and the check came quickly, but it was with our credit-card on the table for about 20 mins. SERIOUSLY! Also, they seem to have some kind of ant problem in the courtyard- we were bit up before we even ordered. \nALL of this being said and the food was great! Not so great that I couldn't make it at home if I had all the ingredients- but still VERY GOOD.",

There isn't enough meat, you can't taste the bacon, the middle of the burrito tasted like mush, and the burrito overall was small. I would recommend skipping the bfast burrito.

I use the word 'famous' because they are heavily embellished with awards even from the Thai Royal government and had serviced big screen celebrities like Jackie Chan, Jessica Alba and the list goes on. Head chef Sasi was an iron chef winner and is celebrity status herself.\n\nWith such an adorned list of accomplishments, we arrived ready to culinarily enlighten. Once you walk up the stairs into the restaurant, the place has an old antique feeling to it like a mashup of a Thai temple and a traditional diner. A little worn but lots of traditional flair.\n\nTheir menu had a lot going on as it was so wordy that it was a little hard to navigate through. We decided to place our full trust in our servers recommendations and ordered the most popular items:\n\n- Tom yum soup: this was the most sour Tom yum I have ever had. The sourness was so overpowering that it was hard for me to enjoy any other flavour that accompanied it.\n- Divine crispy morning glory: battered thai spinach, it was fried similar to tempura style with a nice sweet and sour glaze. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend.\n- Sasi's red curry chicken with lychee: served in a pineapple and had lychee in the curry, interesting concept but can't say I was a fan. The taste was a little bland and it didn't have a strong flavour profile. The chicken meat was also slightly overcooked. \n- Sasi's pad Thai: the noodles were nice and chewy and it was a solid pad thai but again there wasn't a distinctiveness that would make me want to get it again.\n\nOverall, it was still a satisfying meal and I wouldn't go as far to say this is a tourist trap because I'm sure Sasi is a super talented and great chef. However, our actual experience with the food here dulled in comparison to the glowing expectations of celebrity chef resto.",

Me and my girlfriend usually go on a Friday to have drinks after work which is very good and relaxing for us help to get rid of all those weekday problems that you've had all week.\n\nI usually get something simple like a whiskey and coke which for 2 for 1 is 2 for $3.50 which you can't find anywhere besides maybe Fremont Street for even one for $3.50. They have great beer specials as well when I do drink beer I use he can get one of those as well and their two for one that's also. My girlfriend likes to get the margaritas which come in a highball glass and they are $4.50. One thing I will say is that the bartenders are awesome they like to talk I like to be interactive and they like to make you feel like you are family which is a great thing for a bar because then you feel like you want to come back and you want to interact with them as well.\n\nI did notice that they have gotten a new cuz I don't know if the cook overnight is the same or if they have change that I do have one problem the last time I went late at night the bartender had to end up helping the cook get our food out quick cuz it took so long and when it did come it wasn't good and it looks like the bartender had actually gone back and cook the food himself because the cook that was back I didn't know what he was doing that was a very late night for us around 4 a.m. so I have not been back that late to see if the Cook has changed but as far as the one that's there during the happy hour he is pretty good and haven't had any problems since I do only go during the four to seven happy hour.",

Regardless the spot is clean and the doughnut was good. The coffee was quite good too! I finally see why people like it so much it isn't too sweet, but not too strong either. Overall, not a bad place for coffee and a bite, but the service just wasn't the most welcoming. My whole time there I did not return to this site.",

He was slurring his words and seemed drunk. During our meal we noticed German get into an altercation with a guest that was sitting close by.  German followed the guy outside. My girl was curious to see what happened so she stepped outside. She saw German choke the guy and then saw the guy punch German in the face knocking him out cold! The police and ambulance showed up it was a huge scene. For this guy to own two other restaurants in the valley he is highly unprofessional. I've never witnessed such animalistic behavior before, especially in Scottsdale. All in all food was mediocre but it might just have been the owners behavior that ruined our experience. This place won't be open long if German keeps up this behavior, I will NOT be back.",

The meats are so tender, perfectly seasoned & cooked that you don't even need BBQ sauce; but the BBQsauce is also amazing and adds a lil pop & dimension to the flavor profile of the perfectly flavored meats.\n\nThe sides were also not your typical quick, thrown together sides like most places which use prepackaged, bagged & bottled ingredients.  I had the Mac & Cheese - no question that this is homemade (awesomely creamy & perfectly cheesy, not overwhelming-just perfect) & for my 2nd side I had coleslaw. I was totally & absolutely pleasantly surprised. The Coleslaw was also homemade, not bagged cabbage (it was freshly, hand chopped) & mixed w/a homemade, fresh & excitingly flavorful dressing of delightful perfection (not too thick & creamy, yet not too watered down, either - finally after all these yrs ... I've found a coleslaw that has a perfect balance in the dressing consistency, a perfect flavor profile & is made w/fresh, hand chopped cabbage & I can finally say that it's the best slaw I've ever eaten).\n\nMy spouse had a full rack of baby back ribs which he couldn't stop raving about.  Ate the entire rack in 1 setting. The meat literally just fell right off the bones.\n\nIf you're on the North side of Phx- - -trust me when I say this is a Restaurant you MUST visit.

My friend joined me that year and agreed that Hot N Juicy was just that. Since we had a group of 10+ we ordered almost everything on the menu except for the crawfish and lobster. I probably ate my weight in shrimp and crab. The side dishes were a mere afterthought. I did enjoy the corn and rice. Come on, I had to have some rice with the proteins!\n2nd experience:\n\"Dude, I think the guy at the front is hitting on you.\" Our waiter proceeds to act awfully friendly to my co-worker. We picked on him for the rest of the evening. It was cute!\nI was in town for a convention for work. My boss treated us to dinner here. I was so excited since I already knew what to expect. We all ordered our own crab and shared shrimp and sides. The Hot N Juicy special sauce all the way! I learned the ways of H&J.\nLast notes:  If you're in it to win it, go for the H&J special sauce mild. Medium to me seems too spicy, but that's just me.  I'm the type that can't handle Hot Cheetos....This place gets super crowded so it's best to try to get there before the dinner rush if you can.",

    "text": "My husband bought a pearl white 2006 Subaru STI from here back in 2008. The brakes were completely gone within a couple days of him buying it and he had to shell out extra money to get them replaced as they are brembo brakes (not cheap!).  While the brakes were being replaced (at Subaru), it was brought to our attention that the sway bar had broken because it was upside down! Carmax refused to cover the broken sway bar under the warranty because they said the sway bar would flip if taken over a jump and that was not warrantied. What a joke. Don't get me wrong, I love to do jumps in a car with no brakes, makes me feel alive - but this car was not jumped nor driven in such a way that the sway bar could've flipped. It was probably upside down because the previous owner that killed the brakes had some aftermarket junk on the car that he took off before trading the car in and since Carmax apparently doesn't look at sway bars and brakes while inspecting their vehicles, it just flew under the radar. This dealership was the last straw as far as used cars for us. Now we save and buy new.",

That really grosses me out, no matter how much chlorine they dump into the pool.\nWhy, why, why would you ever do that?\n_____\n\nI wish they had longer hours to swim laps without the \"family\" atmosphere. \"Family Swim\" equates to lots of kids doing cannonballs all over the place, gettin' in the way while you're trying to do laps, making off with the equipment you may have hanging out at the end of your lane. Huge bummer. But if you can grab some time without the annoyance of the little ones, the place rocks. $3 entry per swim (not per day). \n\nIMHO, 5 stars if:\n* $3 per day (not per swim).\n*Fire the dude who authorized the dog swim.\n*Clean the locker rooms once in the middle of the day (pretty scary by evening).\n*Family (kid) swim limited to an hour a day, twice a week. Outside. Maybe in another county.",

We went for dinner around 5 pm and felt like were being rushed, the waitress kept harassing us to order our food even though we had probably sat for 5 minutes. None of the staff were friendly. After we did order our food we received it within 7 minutes, which made me think it wasn't very fresh and it didn't taste fresh either. I ordered the Garganelli Geppetto, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. I had a lava cake type of dessert which was actually really good and I enjoyed it. That was the only good part.

Ok, fine, it must be good then! \nAs I'm freezing (no, literally) under 25degrees, we headed in and triumphatly we managed to elbow-wrestle our way to an empty table squeezed in between other tables \"Oops sorry didn't mean to leave my derriere in your food but I like didn't have a choice if I wanted to get to my seat! Looks good though!\"\nBeer menu is very interesting with their own brews and food menu although short is mouth-watering with good food and vegan option which as always doesn't come cheap.\nWe shouted our order to the waitress (see reason below) and got a blonde and a white beer, the Tempeh sandwich and the cheese board. We found nothing exciting with any of it and for the price, were still hungry.\nThe staff is courteous but no more. The atmosphere is really loud from the over-loud volume of the music and everyone trying to shout over it to be heard by their table companions. Plus, seriously, did you have to dim the light to \"darkness level\" at 7pm!? If you want me to pay I will need to find my hand first and eventually, I know you love me, but I will have to find the door to go home!",

I will say after you are in the glitz and glamour of the strip the outside of the Palace Station will have you second guessing your decision to come there. I actually decided to go during a dog show which made it even more interesting. I was told that there would be a wait but it was worth it. After standing in line for almost an hour and a half I will say that the gumbo i had was one of the best gumbos i have ever tasted. I have friends from New Orleans and this topped theirs. The oysters i had were steamed just right. Horseradish sauce had just the right twang to it. If you have a car in Vegas definately go here. It is even worht the bus and cab ride from the strip.",

Very quiet, relaxing and peaceful environment (keep in mind I went on a Monday afternoon though. I am sure it's busier on the weekends!)\n\nWe got the English Tea set and I ordered the Green tea w/ lychee flavors. The tea was quite good but it got lukewarm after a few minutes which is my pet peeve - I love my teas pipin' hot! The finger foods were very high quality but most of the items contained items I am not a huge fan of (e.g. smoked salmon, curry chicken, etc). I actually was hoping for more simple cucumber/ham sandwiches since they go so well with the tea and are easy to eat!\n\nThe dessert was a total miss for me. Way too sugary and sweet for my palate and I barely touched them. I would prefer more finger sandwiches in place of the sweets! Overall, service was great too and the server was very attentive.",

The decor is beautiful and rustic.\nHowever, the moment we ordered we were ignored and forgotten about all night even though we were sitting beside the hostess.  We ordered a lot of food and none of it was spectacular.  \nThe Portuguese Mac and Cheese was bland and unremarkable.  There was not a lot of seasoning and nothing special about it.  \nThe Shrimp Po' Boy Sandwich was waaay over seasoned.  The sauce had a weird taste and was just salt city.  Half of the shrimp was well cooked the other half was overcooked. The only good part of the sandwich was the bread.  \nThe slider platter was supposed to have three distinct flavours, but everyone agreed that it all tasted the same.  The burgers themselves had a funny spongy quality about them which made it off putting. \nThe Goa Chicken was an entree which was twice the cost of an appetizer, but was the same size as an appetizer.  We were almost done dinner and had asked twice about the dish before it finally arrived.  The sauce was not spicy or flavorful,  and the texture of the chicken mimicked the rice.  There was nothing special about this entree and we all agreed it wasn't worth the money.  \nThe pierogies were super sweet for a savoury dish and the dough had a strange texture to it.   It was too much dough and not enough cheese and potato.\nWe all agreed that we wouldn't ever step foot in this place again.",

The first time I rode the light rail I took it from Mill Ave to Phoenix to see the D-Backs and Cubs play. My friends had caught a tram in Mesa so I sat there and watched a few trams come and go before I got onto the one with my friends on it. That was easy enough...there was enough room for me and the ride was smooth and fun (though I can't say it was relaxing)...Any ways. After the game was quite an experience! The tram ride home was a little more crowed now that the game had let out. There were two die hard fans in our car from the two teams who started talking trash to each other...well one of them had a little too much to drink and one thing lead to another and they were soon yelling threats at each other. Right before the drunker one took a swing (in a very crowded car) an older man stood up and shut them both up before someone got hurt...the tension in the air was thick the whole way back to Tempe where the Cub fan got off and punched the window. The friends of the other guy had to hold him back...I mean come on!! \n\nOkay, then I had the pleasure of using the light rail to go to the Circus. Again I was headed to Phoenix but this time I got on at the Washington stop. It was again a fun ride, but I couldn't say that it was a relaxing ride...there was this bum who was asking people for money and I think it would be better with some music playing in the background...any ways the ride home wasn't as eventful as the baseball game crowd, but again, there was another bum asking for money...can people just ride in peace?\n\nI like the light rail - I really do...it's always an interesting experience, but I just don't feel safe on it. I used to take the metro bus from Gilbert to Mesa every day for a while and I felt safer on that then I do on the light rail and the bums who ride the bus don't ask me for money either.",

They will insist you need some sort of major work, have an infection or pending problem and the dentist may or may not even look into your mouth to make this diagnosis.  I don't know if there office was ever very good.  But I do know that my kids do not have many cavities and they are not very excited to see them.  The adults on the other hand, need deep cleaning, anitbiotics to kill infections, extra x-rays, crowns, you name it.  \n\nI thought maybe my first experience was a fluke, so I went back.  Dentist never looked in my mouth and it had been a year and a half, but insisted I still needed the same 4 crowns they had recommended prior.  Meanwhile, I still have those teeth.  Upsell, upsell, upsell.\n\nThe staff stands around and talks about the patients and the Dr. rounds the corner to ask the office girls how many they got today.  Referring to major procedures that called back to schedule. And wheres the respect for patients privacy?\n\nDo not let them touch your teeth or your childrens teeth.  Save your money and find a better office.  \n\nMelanie certainly could brush up on her customer service skills.  When we called back after they had problems and couldn't finish my husband's appt. (claiming they would call him back), she was short, rude and unhelpful.",

Soooo yeah. \n\nWe showed up to wait for a table (mind you there are about 45 tables open outside and we were okay with eating outside). The hostess said it would be a 15 minute wait anyway (why? I don't know). So we're sitting outside by the door and near a fan. We've been waiting for a while and I get up to go check to see if they called our name. Apparently the hostess did (inside? she knew we were outside) and since we weren't there crossed us off the list and moved us to the bottom. She was also very rude to us about it. \n\nWhatever, no big deal. I'll take your attitude, just seat me, I'm starving. \n\nFinally after waiting for a few minutes (this time I stood near their hostess station so they knew I was in existence) and my party was seated. Naturally it was uncomfortably hot but we were seated in probably the worst area. It was so hot, I was disgustingly (and embarrassingly) taking ice out of my drink and letting it melt on my legs. :hangs head in shame:\n\nOur waiter was very nice and made up for the hostess. I wanted lunch and asked for something \"small.\" Apparently their tuna salad was the smallest salad but this thing was massive!!! It was very good, but I'm still cautious about getting fish in the middle of the desert. \n\nAnyway, no dessert. I think if I was back in Vegas and wasty face, I'd make a stop to try the dessert. Otherwise, I probably could get bitched at by a hostess at a snootier restaurant and feel less bad about it.",

Dance floor was too packed and it took me 15 minutes just to leave it. I think several fire codes were violated that night. Main dj (Hardwell) didn't come on until 1:30 pm, at which time it's impossible to even move in the dance floor. Ridiculous prices. Totally not worth it. Hakkasan was a total dud & disappointment.

    "text": "Le Mont just lost $30,000 tonight.\n\nMe, my fianc??, and her mother went to Le Mont for dinner tonight in hopes of locking down a date for our wedding venue next year. Well, I definitely would have thrown my money at them if I wanted countless disappointing memories and an over the top, pretentious, unprofessional, outdated venue.\n\nLe Mont reminds me of a restaurant that made it big in the past with presumably good food, service, and professionalism while of course being complemented by the unmatched view of Pittsburgh. However, complacency must have set in because all of those characteristics were lost along the way.\n\nUpon arrival, we were not greeted with even a hello. We were standing waiting for our table while one of the staff members motioned over to us (while standing deep within the restaurant) to come follow him. If it wasn't for my fianc?? paying attention his efforts would have been useless, while remaining devoid of professionalism.\n\nOur waitor clearly lacked proper training for a place of this caliber. Nothing against him, but if you work hard during the week to go to a restaurant and pay hundreds of dollars for dinner, you would like a waitor that is professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and attentive. For example, he asked me if I would like another cocktail as it was 3/4 finished. I said yes as I proceeded to finish it; meanwhile he waited behind me as I finished the drink and said: \"Oh I'm just waiting for you to finish so I can make you another drink in the same glass.\" WHAT!??!!?\n\nI ordered the filet mignon and said I wanted it between medium and medium rare. His response: \"Well I'll just have them cook it medium rare and if it's undercooked for you I'll have them cook it a little bit more.\" WHAT!??!!\n\nThe side vegetables were 100% frozen and just came out of the microwave, and lacked any effort of seasoning to help disguise its origin, the grocery store shelf.\n\nWhen it was time for dessert, they brought out a food cart of half eaten cakes that looked like they had been raided by a hungry pack of wolves. But, in any attempt to salvage the night, me and my fianc??s mother ordered a slice of cake. The waitor asked my fiance if she wanted anything and she said no because she was full. His response: \"You sure you don't want nuttin?\" WHAT!??! \n\nI ordered a cappuccino which lacked foam and had burnt coffee inside. To top it off, the plate was \"beautifully garnished\" with a shriveled, small, dirty, lemon peel. \"Yes, I love lemon with my coffee.\" When I confronted the waitor about it, he indeed confirmed that it was a garnish. WHAT?!?!?!?!!? \n\nThe bathrooms were dirty, floors were sticky, wall paper was peeling, and outdated. On the way out, no \"have a good night, thank you for coming, etc\" was said. Pretty fitting though - with this poor excuse for a 5 star restaurant I would expect nothing more: lack of professionalism, mediocre precooked food, and ridiculous comments about lemon peels, but definite willingness to take your money.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT. IT NEEDS GORDON RAMSEY, OR A BULLDOZER. SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ELSEWHERE.\n\nJUST GOOGLE THE VIEW.",

They told me it would be forty-five minutes to an hour before it would get here, no problem, it is what it is. After waiting for TWO hours my very polite coworker called to inquire about our order. A man answered the phone and she said, \"I was calling to check on an order\", without asking for a name or what we ordered he said, \"it's on its way\", and he HUNG UP on her. What a bastard!! 15 to 20 minutes later the delivery guy showed up, he was very nice. We couldn't accurately judge if the tardiness was his fault, so unfortunately he was tipped well. After exchanging the money and food we walked to the back because we were starving at this point. My coworker and I have a security camera system set up and we noticed the delivery guy hanging out in the lobby. We stood there and watched the guy pace our lobby pick up a few magazines, flip through them, watch the TV for a solid minute. My coworker and I were actually laughing. At this point being mad wouldn't make it better. However sharing my experience on Yelp would potentially help the next guy know not to order from here for Delivery. The food was was almost room temperature. The cashew chicken that I had ordered had very little chicken (I had to hunt for it to make sure there was any even in the dish!). It didn't lack giant chunks of onion. I like onion, but damn! A coworker had sushi that she didn't even eat after a few pieces, saying it was not good. I did try it, I didn't like it, but that opinion can be taken with a grain of salt due to the fact I'm not a fan in the first place.  -3 stars is my real rating. -1 star for the bastard -1 star for the smug delivery driver and last but certainly not least -1 star for the shitty food.\n\n*** I do notice that others have rated it well, so maybe we caught them on a bad day, but diners-beware!!***",

Having never tasted a porter, I wasn't sure what to expect but was surprised by its flavor and pleasant aroma. Additionally, my friends and I tried a few menu items including a summer sausage sandwich and the homemade pretzel. Both were excellent. I recommend Karben 4 to all beer drinkers, period.

My boyfriend got the hell's kitchen burger & he said it was pretty dang good. \n\nThe oreo shake was the best part, whatever you decide to get, make sure you get a shake. They are phenomenal!",

Long story short: though this place didn't satisfy me to a 5 star degree (food wise), I was super impressed by the service.\n\nI was SUPER hungry before stepping into the restaurant. I checked in on Yelp for a 10% discount and I was ready-to-go. However, the food, (understandably) took some time (as I went with a large party). Again, I was really hungry. I want to emphasize just how hungry I was in order to reveal the accuracy of my 4/5 review. Despite just how hungry I was, the food wasn't THAT impressive. It was standard in terms of quality and portion.\n\nFOOD:\nI got a See Yew spice level 3 (out of 10) with chicken. It was tasty and well-cooked! There wasn't much of a wow-factor though. I tried a bit of my friends' food, and my opinion stands accurate for all the dishes.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nSpacious. There's a bar area. Lots of seating, not as many customers (I went on a Saturday night). However, it's nice and clean. There's also a sanitary bathroom for paying customers.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe waitress was really nice and helpful. She was patient and friendly the whole night. Someone from the kitchen, who I presume to be the owner and/or head chef came out to make sure everything was okay ... and that's really telling of how much the staff care.\n\nI would come here again, but the far distance is a turn-off is I'm being completely honest. But my overall experience was positive.",

    "text": "I've recently did a drysuit neck gasket repair with MEC. And it is my first and last time: the experience has been an ongoing nightmare. \n\nWhen I first inquired about the repair cost, I was told it'd be $35.00. The repair was done in a timely fashion. When I went to pick it up, the cost came up to $120.00. I was in shock and had to re-budget my rent for this month for this shocking repair cost. But I did pay for it. \n\nA week later, the same gasket was torn. (And yes I do take care of them, my head is as small as a child and I even sanded down my nails to prevent any harm to the suit gaskets). I was very upset as I just spent all that money and time on it. This is also the time of the year when I need the drysuit the most. \n\nAs there is a repair warranty, I took the suit back to MEC and politely asked for help. The rep at service desk was very pleasant and helpful. And promised to take care of the repair without charge, under warranty and that the suit would be ready in a few days. Later that day, I received a call from a MEC manager to tell me that's not going to happen and accused me of taking advantage of the shop for multiple gaskets repairs and not paying for them. That they do not cover wear and tear. Wear and tear? It was worn 3 times and was torn again! As if it's normal for their service to hold up for 3 wears. Did I mention the drysuit was $1000.00? And the neck gasket can only be repaired/changed 3 times. \n\nWe came to an agreement that they will cover the repair cost but have no idea when it will be repairs as no one at the shop is willing to do it. So my drysuit is currently sitting in the shop without action and I am cancelling all my paddling plans for the next few weeks and a long October vacation trip. The worst part is, everyone who knows about my repair looks at me as if I'm a criminal. I'm the problem, it's my fault all this is happening. REALLY?! WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?",

I had a yearly contract with an AC, heating and plumbing service from one of the largest (if not the largest) home improvement stores in the country. They gave me a \"VIP price\" of $269 to install it.  I searched the internet and found these great reviews of Arturo the Plumber and decided to call him. He called right back and asked me to text him my address. I sent him my address along with two photos; one of the old faucet and one of the corrosion under the kitchen cabinet, and asked if he could give me an estimate based on the photos. He was able to give me a fantastic estimate about 1/3 the price of my contracted company.  The installation went perfectly and I am now a big fan of Arturo. So, I have learned that big companies charge more and their plumbers work on a commission. This is why it is better to hire a local plumber who can charge a reasonable amount.\nFrom now on Arturo is my man!",

Walked in to browse and see what they had and for a good 10 minutes I walked around and not a single person greeted or even asked if I needed help.

And I mean enjoyed! The location is easy to get to, clean, bright, friendly. Upscale-ish, but comfortable, no pretension. I appreciated the large massage room. I don't like when rooms are so small the masseuse bumps into the table when she/he moves or there's no room for clothes, or, because the rooms are so small you can hear everything going on in the rooms on either side. Not the case here! You'd think with such a fantastic special that the services would be skimpy or cut-rate, but again, not the case! The massage was a combo deep/Swedish by a professional; the facial was thorough with cleansers, moisturizers, masks, extractions, toners...and so relaxing I dozed off. Pedi was a true spa/resort pedicure. Products are available for purchase, but there was absolutely no sales pitch. If you're interested in a product, you'll have to ask. I will be back!",

The beef was thin and delicious covered in truffle oil, parmesean, and arugula. The portion was really large. I am sorry that I didn't just order 5 plates of this for myself instead of the steak trio...I would have been much happier.\n\nRare Steak Trio for Two - the trio consists of a filet mignon, new york strip, and kobe hangar steak. We ordered the steaks medium rare but only the filet was cooked properly...we had to kick back the NY and hangar. The filet was like butter and really delicious. It took a ridiculously long time to get our other 2 steaks back. They eventually arrived at the correct temperature but the hangar steak was inedible because it was so stringy and tough.\n\nRare 120 Herbed Fries - good fries covered in chives, thyme, parsley, and rosemary.\n\nWe were celebrating a birthday and they brought us out a trio of mini desserts (german chocolate cake, brownie smores,  and tiramisu) with candles on top which was very nice.\n\nOur server was very friendly, attentive, and professional. The manager came out and apologized about the steaks. Best part of the evening was that they were showing the movie Flashdance on the wall.\n\nOverall it was a good experience but I think I will stick to Craftsteak for my Las Vegas steak dinners.",

I moved away to Oregon for 13 years and was on a quest... telling people of the awesome tamales I knew in Vegas, I got lots of suggestions but nothing compared to the pork tamales I grew up with, and now that I'm back in Vegas this is a regular stop for me. The rest of their food is OK but nothing beats those Tamales",

The lamb was very tender and the flavor was out of this world. You must order the naan bread. The naan arrived hot right out of the pan and was so nicely chewy.\n\nThe service here is top notch too. They actually care about their customers experience. At one point my significant other commented on how spicy the food was and our server immediately asked if it was too spicy. It was not at all, he just loves spicy food lol.\n\nWe will definitely be back!",

    "text": "OK, so as a new tea drinker I felt I needed to check the place out, even though other Yelpers have given fair warning about the staff and prices.  My 2 experiences have been different from what has been mentioned.  Staff were friendly but not pushy, prices were as expected (they are in a high end mall, folks - the rent must be paid) and the tea was fine.  I liked that they would make a cuppa of whatever they sold (rather than \"this is the flavor of the day\") and even though $4.99 is a bit steep for a cuppa, it is a one-time leaning experience and is helpful in learning whether you want to take this tea home or not.  The only warning I might give is that, in one case, they added a bit of rock sugar to the store sample pot of the mixed chai, so it is sweeter than the actual tea that you might buy.",

Bar wasn't busy at all their was only one other group at bar. You staff is an embarrassment as your space is cool. Never wrote a review in my life.

This has been my first year using KH Financial and I found it to be far more convenient than I imagined possible. This company comes to you! So handy and efficient, and the same price as my former tax guy.

Every month I have to fight with them in order to get the order shipped to me. The first thing I'm told is they denied the order because they don't have the medical necessity on file yet after fighting with them they review the file and find out. Then the order gets stopped in billing due to the same missing documentation. I'm always informed that they will update the file and they don't follow through. Numerous times I've called my insurance company to talk to edgepark with me on the line and supposedly is fixed. On the 1st I call in and low and behold they need the medical necessity. I seem to get the run around. They continually put my order on a hold I'm constantly having to tell them I'm on his last can and by the time I recieve the shipment my 6 month old infant out down to his last few bottles. Why?  How can a company be so incompetent that they cannot update the information on file that they already have in the system?  Why do I have to fight with them every single month?  This past month I called on the 27th to place the order. Customer service supposedly sends the order 4 days pass no package I called back they said I never placed an order. I get switched from one person to another they finally fess up that the order was rotated through 4 customer service reps and then canceled. Why wasn't I informed?  No phone call no email nothing to inform me of the issue. I call on the 1st it's another 2 hour phone call of they need this info they need that it's being held up my coding now it's being held up by billing. Finally the issue is resolved they are sending out formula I recieve an email and surprise I'm only getting half my order. Why?  Today is another merry go round I've talked to probably 10+ reps nobody has an answer and the issue still isn't resolved. Save yourself the stress and go with a different company. Edgepark doesn't care about their customers who depend on them to provide services that they bill insurance for. They show no compassion and no initiative to resolve issues as they arise. This company will do nothing more than frustrate you with every conversation. They are incompetent when it comes to doing their part and point the finger at your insurance company and you as the customer.",

They are so incredibly friendly, and I am glad that this hasn't changed. (Also, we had some broccoli in our Hibachi meals this time, and it was a really inspired addition! I hope that they keep it up.)\n\nWe tried a few new things today. My son said that his order of Spicy chicken was excellent. My husband really enjoyed his scallops, which were nicely browned and seared but still moist and juicy on the inside. The Lobster and Shrimp combo (my order) did not disappoint either. The lobster was sweet and nicely seared (not the usual treatment that Canadians use for lobster, so be prepared - I loved it). The shrimp was as great as ever.  To my taste, Hibachi's signature yum yum sauce is best suited to meats, and their homemade spicy sauce pairs well with seafood.  \n\nHow do they achieve that beautifully seared, flavourful exterior without turning the seafood to rubber? I sure can't do it at home, which makes Hibachi Grill the perfect take-out for a busy night. \n\nNext time, I want to try the unagi.",

    "text": "Bait and switch.  That's the best way to describe these guys.  I was quoted a fixed price for moving things so when they came and worked slowly, I mean it is pretty obvious they were dragging their feet.  I've hired many movers in my life and in my 20 years of hiring movers, I've never seen anyone move this slow.  Not only did they move slow, they decided to wrap my furniture 10 times and did it at a snail's pace.  I didn't complain at first because I was quoted a fix price.\n\nWhen they finished, they actually said it was by the hour and $144.00/hr at that for 3 guys.  This was the first time I heard of that.  The whole job on day 1 took 9 hours including driving time.  However they charged me an extra hour for driving, even though 9 hours already included driving time.  They said this is their standard practice (of bilking customers).\n\nIf I had known, I would have hired much cheaper and honest movers.  Total cost for a local move, $2,900.  They quoted about $1,300.  They even had the nerve to ask me for a review.  So here it is.  They even asked for a tip saying that most people are too cheap to give them one.  I could have hired guys in front of home depot for $500.",

Most items have the same flavour; salt, chili pepper, and cumin. Every item started tasting the same after the first two or three skewers. It masks the natural flavours of the ingredients. \n\nSimilar to other reviewers, my favorite is the Enokitake mushroom skewer and Korean Cabbage. My family did not enjoy any of the meat skewers. They felt lamb skewers lacked the gamey flavour of lamb, beef skewers lacked the earthy flavour of beef. Lastly, chicken gizzard and squid tentacles skewers were very tough. As well, my father felt they used a natural gas grill instead of a traditional charcoal grill. \n\nOverall, 520 BBQ ranges from a 2 to 2.5 stars (rounded to 3 stars for this review), depending on the day.",

The bathroom was outdated with a clogged shower and toilet which required repair from the maintenance crew who looked pretty scary. The air conditioning unit was super loud, loud enough where you could not sleep with it on making it pretty stuffy. Patio area outside was a nice touch but the patio chairs and table were filthy. The only good thing about this \"resort\" was the pool and hot tub. Definately not worth the $18 per day resort fee. Would not recommend this property",

When we asked for the check he delivered it and then failed to come back for our credit card in a timely manner. He walked by our table several times before I flagged him down in desperation. Instead of apologizing he feigned surprise. Terrible.\n\nSuffice it to say the service we experienced at your restaurant left much to be desired.

    "text": "Can a single meal completely change your perception of fine dining?\n\nCan a single meal radically alter your relationship with food in general?\n\nI think it can -- and Sage proves it.  After my dinner here, I'll never look at food quite the same way again.  To say it was my favorite meal in Las Vegas would be an understatement.  It would be more accurate to say it was one of my top meals of *all time*.\n\nIt began with an 8pm reservation for two.  Sage, located in the Aria hotel, has a relatively unassuming entrance, but that belies that grandeur to be found inside.  The restaurant is immense, with high ceilings, sumptuous furnishings, and a gorgeous color scheme with lots of golds accents and stunning chandeliers.  Needless to say, Sage is just as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the taste buds. \n\nAfter we were seated, our incredibly friendly and kind server, John, came by with the breadbasket.  We each had the sourdough roll and a bacon brioche -- and both were excellent.  They were served with sea salt (served on a tablespoon) and whipped butter. \n\nDeciding what to order was easy as pie -- we both had the 4-course tasting menu ($79).  My dinner companion splurged on the wine pairing ($39).  Our server's wine pours were *very* generous -- a lot more than the advertised half glass per course .  In fact, I was able to enjoy some wine with every course without bothering to order the wine pairing myself. \n\nBelow is a run-down of everything that we ate.  Absolutely everything was cooked and presented with the utmost class and sophistication.  The refinement of this dinner was unlike anything I'd previously experienced.\n\n**AMUSE BOUCHE ... PRE-DINNER**\nA shot glass of gazpacho.  Fresh and tangy.  A wonderful starter.\n\n**COURSE #1**\nWagyu beef tartare with buttered crostini.  Easily the finest tartare I've ever had.  The beef was unctuous and fresh; the egg only added to the indulgence.  Chocolate shavings provided an unexpected layer of complexity.\n\n**COURSE #2**\nSeared Maine dayboat scallops with broccolini, braised oxtail, mushrooms, and caramel reduction.  The scallops were cooked beautifully and fall apart when touched with a fork.  The broccolini was tender.  The caramel sauce provided an intriguing sweetness that contrasted against the saltiness of the shellfish.\n\n**COURSE #3**\n48 hour beef belly with braised apples.  I've never had beef this tender and succulent in my life.  Each bite dissolves on your palate and overwhelms you with flavor.  Apples provide a gentle acidity that works well against the umami of the beef.\n\n**COURSE #4**\nPistachio tart with strawberry ice cream.  A culinary work of art -- oodles of individual components meticulously arranged.  Bold, fresh flavors all over the plate.  An enjoyable juxtaposition of hot and cold. \n\n**AMUSE BOUCHE ... POST-DINNER**\nHot white chocolate with mint and coconut, served in a white porcelain shot glass.  A sweet, uplifting treat at the end of a fantastic meal.\n\nAfter this meal, I wasn't just full and satisfied -- I was exhilarated, knowing that I had a world-class gastronomic experience.  The staff at Sage earned every penny of their tip.\n\nThis isn't the sort of meal I can have everyday -- but it's worth doing once in a while, if for no other reason to remind yourself that fine dining can truly be life-changing.\n\nIf you subscribe to the \"you only live once\" philosophy, than a dinner at Sage is a must.",

    "text": "I bought a new bike here about 2.5 years ago and went in for a tune-up the other weekend and was reminded of how wonderful my initial purchase experience was. \n\nI didn't have a bike growing up, so learning to ride a bike as an adult was terrifying, and buying the right bike was really important. The staff took their time with me, showing me lots of options, and helping me take them out on the sidewalk to test. They were patient and kind. \n\nMy bike has been amazing, great quality, perfect for my needs. I had shopped around a lot (I had gone to about 12 different shops and stores) when I was looking for my first bike, and the bike prices here were really outstanding. \n\nWhen I went back in to get it tuned up, they got it done in just 15 minutes - I am not sure this can always be done so quickly, but certainly I was impressed and very pleased. \n\nI noticed one negative review about the prices for accessories - I have to agree that accessories seemed a bit pricey here, and have bought my lights, helmet, etc. from MEC which has very reasonable prices. \n\nWhen it comes to buying a new or used bike, and getting it serviced, I can't recommend this place enough.",

    "text": "This place gave me that good feeling of the small business.  The employees seemed to actually care and put pride in their job.  One of the cooks came outside and asked my family how the food was a+ dude!!  As for the food.. I god a basket which included chili cheese fries, chicken tenders, and spicy chicken tenders... all of which were awesome.  Portion size was beyond reasonable for the cost but this was all offset by the fact that the food was good and fresh and made by someone who put pride in his job. I wish I could remember his name, I was suprised when I asked if he was the owner and he said he was just a cook and that he cared about making quality food for the guests,  THAT MAN DESERVES A RAISE! A++ highly recommended will go back and bring guests.\n\n**update 5/13\n\nWent back excited to have the wonderful chicken...\nThe blonde Amazon woman at the register should at least make an attempt to be more service oriented. Looking away while I was ordering, I didn't even know if she was listening to me. Questions about the food were answered but it seemed like they were an inconvenience for her to answer.  On the flip side the 2 men that were working were super friendly, hats off to them.  As for the food... I'll have to go back to confirm but it did not taste like I remembered, it really wasn't as good as I remember. I will go back for another try and update.  Peace out yelpers!",

    "text": "So I had a consultation to get my lips to a luscious shape that I have always wanted. My appointment was May 23. It was supposed to be May 22 but the doctors offices called and asked if I could switch it to the 23 which was no problem. I was greeted by a very nice, sweet, professional lady (I am so sorry I forgot your name) she handed me my paperwork and said if I had questions don't hesitate to ask. I waited about 5 minutes and I was greeted by Blanca (I only remember her cause I have her card). She took me back to an examination room and asked what brings me to them. I told her I wanted nice big lips but not fake. She said she knew exactly what I met. She said your lips are definitely small and could use a little something lol. She had me at that answer. Honestly is the best policy! We went through two different fillers I could use and the prices. She handed me what she quoted me on and I am set up to have my lips done June 26th! She showed me two ladies that worked in the office(I am so so sorry I forgot your names) that had there lips done and they were gorgeous. I have read the reviews on here and it scares me a little but personally I had a great experience. I also did my research:)",

    "text": "Okay, honestly, Honey Bear's couldn't hang in Memphis, Birmingham, Houston, or Lockhart  ... and fortunately for them, they don't need to 'hang' because they are smoking their meats in the BBQ wasteland of Phoenix, AZ.  \n\nBecause I fancy myself a BBQ expert (note: I'm more of a brisket purist), its difficult to rate HB's based on the integrity of the THEIR OWN meat and not as a comparison to others Valley and Nation-wide. This is exactly 'why' I think many of their rating suffer because everyone has undoubtedly had better BBQ elsewhere, wherever you may hail from, and it takes a stringent push from one's own natural reflexes to resist matching HBs up to 'local awesome BBQ joint'.  BBQ connoisseurs are funny like that.\n\nSo, overall, HB's earns a 3-star based on the following:\n\nPork Ribs - I'm more of a beef rib expert, but these ribs were generous and plentiful in their combo plate.  I was surprised that there was very likely a whole half-rack on my plate.  They are very tasty even without the sauce, with a nice peppery rub that did not dry out the meat.\n\nSmoked Chicken - Juicy but slightly greasy.  This is amongst the most difficult smoked meat to pull off due to the propensity for it to become a stringy, dehydrated mess.  I don't think I would order it again, but the flavor was pretty decent and I don't regret trying it.\n\nPulled Pork - I got a 1/2 lb of pulled pork as a side meat, along with a couple of extra buns to make as a half-sandwich (a glob of meat on a half bun, folded over like a taco).  This is the only time I typically use sauce to counterbalance the white bread, whether its pork, brisket, or sausage.  I was surprised by how dry the pork was, particularly because pork is fatty and juicy, but here at HB's it was extra lean.  I thought I would hate the pork bc of this fact, but the sauce saves it from being a choking bolus of pig and flour.  Now I understand why they typically put this on a full bun and drown it in sauce.  As the 'specialty' of this restaurant, its kind of a gaffe that the quality is poor, but as a consumer, I'd order it again in limited amounts, and only as a 'side'.  Why?  Because I can provide my own perfect ratio of bread:pork:sauce.  Otherwise, I don't think that HB's could build me a pulled pork sandwich I could be happy with.\n\nSauce - If you don't know any better you'd think it was tip-top.  Sure, its 'pretty good', but its most-definitely a one-note mixture.  Too sweet for their peppery rubs.  A spicier sauce would do the trick better, IMO.\n\nCorn on the Cob - Serviceable, but soggy and strangely devoid of spices typical of southern cuisine.\n\nCowbro Beans - Awesome.  Smokey flavor, thick sauce, and chunks of their smoked sausage.  Great compliment to a BBQ dinner.\n\nSoda Fountain - The city's best.  BBQ restaurant staples such as 1a) Dr Pepper 1b) Big Red.  Their 'cola' is RC and they have Hines Rootbeer, Sunkist, Country Time Lemonade, and 7-Up.  They did some solid research on the fluid necessities of BBQ palates.  They also have a fridge of beer.\n\nPrice -  All that, which I described above came out to $33 with a large tip because the guy behind the counter was very cool.  It fed two hungry people during the season finale of LOST, with plenty extra for leftovers.  Very pleased in this area.\n\nOverall - Hey, its PHX, and here we are better adapted to 'fill-ins' for our favorite spots back home.  It happens in every culinary category, from philly cheesesteaks to fish n chips; gnocchi to Q.  Why should this place be any different?",

This was a good experience. The service was excellent. Our group conversed with several different waiters asking questions about the decor and food. Everyone was gracious and fun to talk to. We had reservations and came early to find they had our table ready. Unfortunately a few of our group did not show. Those who came loved the food. I only gave this a 4 because my salad was not the best. The tuna was excellent but it had too many salty items on the plate (lots of beans, olives, and a few other bland vegetables). The salad dressing was excellent. Other plates (salmon bowl, veggie burger, special bowl, sandwiches)  looked delicious. Everyone was happy and they even gave us our required separate checks with a smile. We will go here again. I want to try the dessert menu next time. The carrot cake looked amazing.",

Then he told me he has a girlfriend, who is in a coma in Australia but he's texting her every day. Bonus #2: He threw trash on my driveway.

The Spinach lives up to the hype people don't mess up your opportunity to order this delicious item. For our entrees we had the Pad Thai and the seafood coconut curry. I'm about to say something crazy but this was the best Pad Thai I have ever had ! Hands down it's amazing. The seafood coconut curry has an egg cracked inside of it which changes the texture from a smooth curry to one with a little chew.

I really didn't understand the hype until I tried it! 19 ingredients, excellent presentation and the flavors are amazing.  We also had the chicken dish since it was the very item that won Chef Lee, Top Chef. It was excellent! Also don't miss the Sangria. Refreshing, 25 ingredients including a tropical fruit cocktail that is left to enjoy in your glass. Service was exceptional and patio was a great atmosphere. I would return and try more items that looked amazing as I watched them all delivered to other tables. Great place!",

    "text": "I wish I could give more stars because the management is super friendly and accommodating and the place is very clean and well taken care of. Unfortunately, I will not return because I had a very uncomfortable experience last weekend with a nail technician blaming me for a schedule mixup and raising her voice at me in front of other customers as she is doing my manicure. For 9 months I had always, always scheduled with the same two technicians.. one does my mani and the other my pedi simultaneously. I scheduled with both, signed in and indicated both their names and I also told the front desk that I am scheduled with both ladies. I was called back by the lady who does my pedicures and she stared my manicure instead. I was confused but I assumed the front desk arranged this because my manicure lady had just starts applying polish a few seats away on another customer. I had no problem with that and was willing to stay a little longer because I knew it was worth having the lady do both. Front desk came by and apologized for not telling the technician that I had scheduled with both and that it would take longer. I had no problem because mix ups happen and it was the first mishap anyway. As the lady is doing my pedicure she asked why I didn't notify her that someone else is doing my manicure. This caught me off guard and told her I thought it's what the front desk arranged. She raised her voice said no and that it was my job to tell her this info. I advised that it was a misunderstanding and again she raised her voice and said \"next time, you have to tell me\" in a very rude tone and I had about 4-5 technicians along with their customers staring at me. I finally snapped back raising my voice and told her to stop raising her voice at me because i don't work there and it isn't my responsibility to arrange it and she can discuss it with the front desk. I felt SO uncomfortable. I only go to her because her work is so clean regardless of the fact that in the last 9 months she can't even manage to look me in the face and say hi. She decided to be nice after and call me \"sweetie\" and \"love\" when time came to pay. I won't put up with that fakeness and rude attitude. I'd rather she not talk to me at all and just fix my nails rather than talk to me as if I owe her something. Owners weren't there so I'm leaving this review because this info probably never got to them even after I called and complained. Oh and the techs were arguing over who was going to do my pedi. She was forced to do it and wasn't happy about it. Please get your nail techs in check and fix their attitudes. All I wanted was a quiet nail session and instead I walked out embarrassed.",

We ended up filling it up pretty high, but we had over 25 tubs of computer parts, college things from the 80's, and more obsolete things that were taking up a lot of space. This company was extremely helpful, quick, reliable, customer-service oriented, timely, and friendly. They allowed us to have the bin for as long as we wanted, and told us they \"don't recognize holidays, and would come at any time.\" With this being right at Christmas time (literally we emailed them in the evening on the 21st and were able to get a bin the 22nd in the early morning) we were astounded with how great they were. The man who dropped off the bin told us that he was more than happy to do this, and had even cracked 4 ribs the day before! Talk about high quality people! The man who was picking up our bin even picked up stray pieces of trash that was on our driveway. The bin doesn't even touch the driveway! How amazing is that? They load it on wood so that it doesn't cause any driveway damage and will sweep your driveway afterwards! We are SO impressed with the quality of service we received, and intend on using them again when we go through our garage. Thanks for giving us part of our house back!",

I'll get 2 or 3 depending on how hungry I am.  Last night I enjoyed the Gorgonzola Prosciutto Chips which were very tasty, even if I am 99% sure it was just ham and not prosciutto (lol).  The Gorgonzola sauce is the bomb.  I seriously wanted to lick my plate.\nTheir beers are good and I am not a beer drinker at all.  My husband ordered their new pumpkin spice brew and I kept stealing sips, it was so delicious!\nThis location has fantastic atmosphere, being in the middle of the hopping section of Mill Ave.  That being said, parking is horrific on a Friday night.  Our service was really fantastic. \nAll in all, a great place and we'll definitely return.",

    "text": "Perfect restaurant to bring visitors to the Old Port of Montreal for work dinner. The ambiance is great, stone walls, beautiful ceilings and operating fire place on each floor. If the municipality of Montreal could fix the side street our guests would be even more impressed, but of course that has nothing to do with the food quality.\n\nThe restaurant is advertising itself as a steak house and they are proud of their Canadian beef, as such they really know how to make a good steak. Very happy with my centre cut fillet mignon, prepared exactly medium rare as requested, very slightly burned from outside as I like it. Besides the steaks some of my companions also enjoyed their black cod. We wanted to share with our guests the pride of the Montreal cuisine, the roast beef poutine. The poutine was a little bit disappointing, fries were kind of cold and the roast beef presence was minimal. I guess we shocked the chef with that order. \n\nThe service is great. I started the night with classic dry martini, so good. The cocktail list needs to be explored by me again. With that said I would come some other time for a personal dinner and when in need of a good steak.",

Upstairs is small and usually has a private party going on, but when it doesn't it plays a different style of music (depending on who's DJ'ing sometimes it's better/worse than downstairs).\n\nClientele: Kind of a bit on the douchy side, but there's a mixed variety here, and it really depends on the night (if there's a special event going on for example).\n\nPatio: I've gotta admit their patio is amazing.  It was decent before, but they've renovated and now it's just massive.  It's big enough i can go out there to relax and get a break from the dance floor; even as a non-smoker i barely notice that everyone is smoking. If i was only rating their patio they'd get 5/5.\n\nDress code: you can get in with pretty much anything if you're not too drunk, judging by all the graphic tee's.  They sometimes restrict sneakers (if they're busy) but mostly they don't care if you can afford the $20 cover.  If you're in a blazer you'll be the best dressed person in there.\n\nBottle service: the one time we got bottle service here we had a blast until we went to go dance.  We left our half-finished bottle with the bartender, and when we returned to claim it they told us it had been finished when we dropped it off. With a group of drunk guys i suppose it's possible, but we all agreed that there was definitely SOMETHING left in our bottle when we dropped it off.",

I loooooooooooove cafes where I can sit and enjoy their goodies in peace. I don't like visiting a beautiful coffee shop and feel like people are rushing me. Because I can make my own good coffee at home, you know? Why would I bother coming to a coffee shop if I can't stay?\n\nMamie Clafoutis makes incredible pistachio croissants and almond croissants, as well as cookies and tonssssss of bread. PLUS they have lots and lots and lots of comfortable seating upstairs. The tables are big enough for a computer and a Wacom tablet, messy papers and pencils, textbooks, and my food and coffee. This is bigger than my desk at home! Also lots of OUTLETS!! LOTS OF POWER!!!!!!!!!! \n\nI originally wanted to do a Sherbrook station bakery hop, but I visited Mamie Clafoutis first and never left. It's so comfortable here that I called my friend, and we both studied here. The table is big enough for both our stuff.\n\nThis is, in fact, my heaven. Washrooms are clean. Wifi is not super fast when more people are here, but it is faster than Starbucks and 100% working. Staff is absolutely wonderful. The smell of the bakery is delightful, so feel free to watch the kitchen from upstairs!\n\nThe pistachio croissant plus cafe au lait is about $8. But this isn't the typical airy and tiny croissant. The croissant is quite filling and heavy! I looooooved mine. The almond is good too!",

    "text": "Came to the Flamingo for 4 nights for my birthday. I booked it through hotels.com and booked a strip view room. Upon getting there, they gave me a room with the Ferris wheel view, and would not accommodate what I had originally purchased. They stated those rooms were full. \n\nPros- The location of the strip is great, its in the heart of the strip, with 4 star hotels and casinos near by. Its also near a lot of restaurants and a couple clubs. The outdoor lighting of the flamingo gives it a lot of spunk. \n\nCons- The room I had was pretty dark, but the overall cleanliness wasn't something to go home talking about. You get what you pay for here. I wish there was a way I could've got my money back for a night, due to the TV not working. I asked the front desk and nobody ever showed up and they did not change my room. The room was \"non smoking\" but smelled like the previous guests had smoked in there. There were cob webs on the window. \nThe shower pressure was very low and there was a roach on the floor. I wish I had taken pictures but we spent most of the time outside of the room. \n They also didn't mention the resort fee until we got there, what if we weren't prepared for that? Next time I come here, I highly doubt ill be staying at the Flamingo again.",

    "text": "I took my 10 year old niece to get our finger and toenails painted as a reward for her completion of school.  I made an appointment in advance.  I let them know that we would come in with clean nails ready to be painted, that we didn't want clippers, files, etc.  Just your basic polish and go.  \nWhen we arrived, the receptionist took us back to a manicurist station and painted my niece's nails in about 4 minutes, and then grabbed her feet from under the table and painted them.  I asked if she would let my niece move to the pedicure chair so she could have the \"experience\" of getting a massage and having her toes painted, i.e. to feel like a big girl.  She flat out told me \"no.\"  I'm not confrontational or anything, but I did question why not since we: a) made an appointment; and b) there were 5-6 open chairs.  She just told me that other appointments were scheduled.  \nThen, another lady arrived to paint my nails.  She painted mine in record speed.  I never understand how someone can manage to paint all over your skin but miss the edges of your nails at the same time.  Must be purposeful?  Not sure.  I took the polish off myself when I went home.\nAnyway, the customer service was bad, the work was bad, and it was just a bad experience all together.  Also, the salon is super tiny and cramped and not fancy at all.  Basically, huge letdown.",

    "text": "Well first of, I was born and raised in India and have been cooking now for over a decade, so I'd like to think I have a good idea of Indian food. My fiance and I decided to try Passage to India today for lunch. We ordered the Chicken 65 for our appetizer. It was definitely not authentic, it was below average, too much cumin in my opinion and way too much cilantro. But the chicken was tender. We ordered it medium, it was fairly bland ( and I can't really eat spicy food).\n\nI ordered the Chicken Biryani (boneless) and my fiance ordered the Chicken vindaloo, both medium spice level as well. I assumed boneless meant chicken breast, not dark meat without the bone. If I knew that was the case I would not have ordered it and paid extra for boneless chicken. It was full of cilantro (no brown onions at all) and it was more or a bland pulao than biryani. The rice was dry and undercooked and stale tasting. The waitress actually forgot to bring out the rice that is complimentary with the vindaloo and we ended up waiting about 10 minutes till we found another waiter who brought it out for us. This rice too was cold and stale. It definitely was not basmati (didn't have the smell or taste of basmati). Both dishes had no flavor, the vindaloo didn't taste anything like the peppery vinegary dish it was meant to taste like. I have a hard time believing the cooks are Indian.\n\nThe food overall was a complete disappointment and I would never recommend this place, especially not for the price. Save your money.",

    "text": "About a year ago, I was aimlessly strolling thru the Cosmopolitan, taking in all the beauty that the hotel has to offer.  While walking around the Chandelier Bar on the upper floors, I stumbled across a long hallway lined with album covers, with a questionable ending.  What could be at the end? Narnia? Or the Springfield Mystery Spot, complete with Ozzie Smith? Of course, being the quizzical individual that I am, I walked down the hallway.  Couldn't believe what I saw...a walk-up pizza joint!\n\nAnyway, with over 500 reviews, I don't know how this is a secret anymore.  No sign, no advertising, but excellent NY-style pizza.  At $4.50/slice, with the Strip-markup, it's a pretty good value for wasteepants late-night munchies.  And if you're not ready to end the rager, they have beer and I think, boxed wine.\n\nThis is obviously a place to go after a night throwin elbows at the club.  At times, I've seen the line full of button-down shirts, fist pumps, sky-high heels, and dresses that leave little to the imagination.  Sometimes the line is long, which is understandable given its popularity.  But they try their best to keep the line moving swiftly.\n\nI'm glad I stumbled onto this place, as it has become a staple when I visit.   I applaud the Cosmopolitan for this inspired idea.",

It was a mushroom salad with yuzu dressing that wasn't on the menu but the chef wanted us to try it - and it should be! \nWe ordered the Korean pancake (vegetarian), the beef bulgogi, 2x bibimbaps, the tofu and kimchi stew (a fave), and the sweet potato glass noodles (another fave!) and there was plenty of food! Along with the complimentary mushroom salad, we were given kimchi, and some pickles to start and also had cold roasted corn tea (delicious!) so I would say this was a very well priced meal around $25 per person. The food was all very tasty and the portions were generous - we were 5 and we had plenty to try from each dish. \nThey are yet to obtain a liquor license so we did not drink. \nI am very happy this restaurant has opened and I wish them every success! Go try it!! Let's keep this neighbourhood full of local, independent and family run businesses like this one! I look forward to returning.",

Price was consistent with the level of quality and service.  Don't overdress -- we wore coat and tie and dress and probably the only ones in the place.  Business casual would have been fine or a sport jacket.  I'd go back, great steak!",

Great food, great service, and a nice classy atmosphere. it was expensive, but you get what you pay for, I was surprised at the lack of customers on a Friday at 7:30PM (prime time dining) we were the only people at the bar and the dining room was about 3/4 full. We had calamari and Steak Tartar which was good, but the Lobster Gnocchi and Beef Tenderloin were fantastic. I would definitely return",

    "text": "Horrible. Worst I have been treated since I have been in Phoenix (five years). There are signs on the pumps that state, \"To prevent fraud, all credit card transactions must be done inside.\" I thought it odd, but walked inside. The guy who worked there said hi. I said, \"Hi. I'm wondering, why do you have to come inside to pay?\" He said, harshly, \"Did you read the signs?\" I said, \"Yes,\" He said, \"Then you just answered your question, didn't you, buddy? Not too tough, was it?\" I looked at him, incredulous. Seemed like a harmless question. I turned to walk out, saying, \"I think I'll get gas somewhere else.\" He said, \"You do that, buddy. No skin off my back.\"\n\nBased on the fact that there was nobody else there, I think it probably was. Maybe not the douchebag I talked to, but the owner probably wouldn't appreciate the fact that his employees are treating customers like that.\n\nWell, I guess I'm not a customer.\n\nNever will be, either.",

The first thing that set the tone on a negative note was that they didn't have me on guest list when I clearly signed up before the closing time on their official website. I got there around 11:30 and the cover was already $20...I wasn't impressed so far.\n\nThe venue is very small compared to all the other clubs I've ever been to. Did I mention that the drinks are priced very high? Second thing that wasn't impressive. However, the music wasn't bad as the night went on.\n\nOverall, the club was alright because of the music and I was with friends. I would give Dolce 3.5 stars but the pricey cover and drinks lowered it down to a 3. I would only go here if there was no cover for ladies before 11...I probably would have to drink a lot prior to entering too.",

    "text": "I don't normally write reviews for restaurants, but our experience here was so good that it deserves to be shared. We walked in without a reservation at 8pm on a rainy Friday night. The hostess graciously offered us our choice of table.  (Btw,why isn't this a standard practice at more places? But I digress). As we were seated and given our menus, the hostess informed us that \"the best table in the house\" was available, and led us to a comfy, cozy, well-lit booth in the back of the restaurant. We're off to a good start so far, I thought to myself. \n\nBut we were only just beginning. \n\nOur server was very polite and knowledgeable, and the food...was excellent. The portion sizes weren't tiny, but they weren't huge. The spinach salad was perfectly dressed, not overpowering at all, but subtle enough to be noticed. Our entrees were delicious! You can absolutely tell the freshness of the pasta.  Although I will say, the gnocchi was a little soft for our liking. We'll give them a pass though, because the espresso martini may have been the best martini I've ever had. And I didn't think I'd say that about a place in Champaign. \n\nThroughout our meal, we observed the owner walking the dining room floor and talking to the customers. He personally stopped by our table to ask us about our experience. We were delighted to tell him we'll absolutely be coming back. If you need a nice night out, I highly recommend Nando Milano. Just bring your checkbook, you'll need it.",

    "text": "I went to this Hooters on 9/12/17 around 12:00 PM.  The place was dead and should have been in tip top shape.  Not the case.  Under my table, I looked because my child had dropped a crayon, it looked like days worth of old food, crumbs and other debris.  The reason I say this is their were a few Hooters girls on \"break\" taking care of one of their kids while supposedly working while their significant other was there sitting in front of us, for over an hour while other girls continued to sit with them, one of whom was our waitress.  (mind you only one other table had anyone at it.) The manager on duty also took part in this.  The real issue here is I ordered wings with no side dressing, my wife then ordered an extra side, which should have been mine given to her, nope they charged $1 and some change for it.  I had 2 chicken wings out of six in which I found hairs coming in and out of the breading,  (I shave my head so 100% not mine.) I informed this waitress with the response of \" It's prolly just the feathers.\" \"would you like to make more.\"  No I don't want more the hairs are in the batter.  I'm sorry but I work in customer service, and she should have informed the manager, who vanished after my complaint, to take care of my issue.  Needless to say I paid for six wings, when only four were edible, paid for extra dressing when it was mine just given to my wife.  Place is disgusting and would highly recomend the health department check this place out.  If it was this bad in the front of house and in the food, I can only wonder how horrific it must be in the back of house.  I WOULD LOVE A RESPONSE FROM THE MANAGEMENT OR OWNER TO THIS.",

    "text": "Purchased a brand new 2016 Hyundai Veloster Turbo in February from Antonio Grant. This was my very first purchase on my own as a 24-year-old woman. My family has purchased multiple cars via him. He is the best dealer at this Hyundai location and really goes above and beyond for his customers. Unfortunately, the customer service provided by his fellow peers do not match his. Hopefully, the story below will defer first time buyers like me away from a bad dealership with terrible customer service. \n\n7/31 Took a hiking trip and made it back home safely when this brand-new car under 7,000 miles battery died. This was odd for me because it is a brand-new car so I didn't understand why the car just died. All my key fobs were not working and no power to the entire car. At this point I was fine because I knew it would be fixed under the warranty. Called Antonio to let him know what was going on, he advised me that I had roadside assistance for 5 years so I called to get the battery jumped, and it didn't work so Antonio asked me to bring the car to the dealership. After arriving there I was immediately greeted (if that's what you call it) with distasteful customer service. A service clerk named Linda chastised me and the representative from the towing company with a negative tone basically asking why we were there and blocking her service area instead of directing us where we needed to go, saw that we were being serviced already and passed us off in an extremely rude manner. Mind you I later saw her help three other customers with the exact opposite kind of attitude, so it's not like she was having a bad day, I'm assuming we were just a problem for her. My normal service representative was busy so I was passed off to another rep to assist in getting a courtesy car. I had to go to get the car myself, and also received it with no gas, after telling the rep three times, he then had it filled. No one asked if I needed help with anything else, or told me when I should be expecting my vehicle, NO ONE ASKED ME FOR THE KEY TO MY CAR AT A CAR DEALERSHIP, and my problems seemed to be an inconvenience to every and anyone at the dealership.\n\n8/2 Went to pick-up the vehicle and showed up with no one inside the facility. After searching, I found the General Manager of the branch who proceeded to walk me to the service area to get my vehicle, I knew he had heard of my experience previously, so out of knowledge of \"good\" customer service, I expected him to ask what happened, but he seemed to show no interest in it. After receiving my vehicle, I told the manager I wouldn't be returning, and all I got was an uninterested \"Sad to hear it,\" and I drove off of the lot. I'm usually not the type to speak on bad service but previously, I've recommended this place to many family members and friends, so I'm doing this in hopes that no one will have to deal with this kind of service again.",

    "text": "Wow, I can't believe there's only a few reviews of this company.   I met a SunRun sales rep in Costco one day.  I asked him some technical questions with no intent to purchase a system.  A follow up meeting at my house by one of the sales team answered my remaining questions.  It seemed almost too good so I told them I would think about it.  I called some of the other solar installers in Las Vegas and told them the deal.   They told me that they couldn't even come close and would not return my calls for a formal quote.  Yes, that is absolutely true!\n\nWe opted to buy out the lease outright which gives us a solar system for 20 years with free maintenance and support the whole time.  The equipment is theirs but I think it's much like a cell phone.  You'll want to upgrade before the end of 20 years anyways.  I calculate my cost to be 8.55 cents per kw/hr compared to that of 13.1 cents per kw/hr of NV Energy.  We only get a $14 bill from the power company now; which is well worth it for the net metering service they provide (which means every ounce of unused solar power produced by the system can be sent to the grid for later use) .  No other costs as everything for the next 20 years was paid upfront.    \n\nI know they are new in town and they wanted to make a good impression with the new trucks and equipment, but they followed through with installers that were exceptionally professional.  They kept me informed during every part of the installation.   They installed the system in only a few days and I was very happy with the end result; both with the solar panel placement on the roof and the inverter placement inside the garage (my preference).\n\nBecause I signed up when they were at Costco, we received coupons for free Costco membership renewal and a $500 Costco card.   It takes a while to get both, but they came without me asking for them.\n\nI just couldn't be happier and I don't normally write reviews.  I do, however, use Yelp a lot to decide on services for the house, so I just thought I would take a few minutes and contribute.  I would do this again with SunRun \"in a minute\".

The curtains I liked weren't in stock at that time and Timothy called the other branches to see if they had it on hand. The check out was fast and easy, and Jim even honored the discounted price for the item we bought few days ago that was regularly priced. And Page bought a hula hoop for my girls and thought that was very sweet. We loved the staff over at this location. Keep up the good work guys!",

    "text": "This is actually one of my favorite places to eat, they have a good variety of creeps, savory crapes, as well as waffles. They're hot chocolate selection is excellent. Their group platters are fantastic, including a need for little roasting hot for your marshmallows. \n\nWe have noticed, however, at that in the past few weeks they have unfortunately decreased the number of servers thing to one person. It takes forever to try to order something, or get the bill, and get the machine for the bill. You don't get checked on as frequently, and usually the waiter on staff, the only waiter, isfrantically trying to serve the customers, and clearly is trying to do the best that they can. \n\nI think management should consider adding 2 Waiters for the evening service at a minimum, so that the customer service doesn't decline as a result. We still want to continue coming here, we hope this gets resolved soon. We would hate for this please, to be known as \"the place where you have to wait forever\".\n\nI'll update this review if we hear back from management or if they start adding more personnel.",

    "text": "Having seen that the line for the Wynn Buffet was at least a good hour and a half long, my friends and I headed a little further down the hall to the Terrace Pointe Cafe.  The wait was only about 15 minutes; we were seated, given menus, and waited about another 15 minutes for our waitress to come over.  \n\nOnce she did she was very pleasant, and got our orders in promptly.  I started with the tomato bisque, which was advertised as coming with a mini grilled cheese sandwich.  Maybe because I got the cup instead of the bowl, it didn't come with one.  The soup was WAY too sweet, but otherwise had good texture, and a nice background kick.  \n\nMy entree was sorely disappointing.  I got the carne asada, which was pieces of skirt steak wrapped in corn tortillas with chopped onions and cilantro.  It came with a tomato rice, a tortilla bowl filled with pinto beans and melted cheese, and a little side of salsa.  It was all just so...bla.  Nothing about it was bad; it just wasn't that good.  The tomato rice was probably the most flavorful thing on the plate.  The portion was also way too large.\n\nMy dessert was the best part of the meal.  I got the cheesecake sampler, which came with three mini cheescakes on a plate- one plain with 2 fresh blackberries on top, one mango with fresh mango chunks on top, and the other chocolate with a truffle.  The mango was the best out of the three, although the plain was a close second, with a true New York cheesecake flavor and nice graham cracker crust.  My cafe latte was  large and very hot, which is nice since they can often be lukewarm.\n\nThe service from start to finish was super sloooow.  It took us TWO HOURS to eat lunch, and we are not slow eaters.  And considering that the delicious Wynn buffet was only $30 for the champagne brunch that day, the $45 + tip that I paid for this mediocre meal was really painful.\n\nThe one high point of the experience was the decor and ambiance of the place.  Like the rest of the Wynn, it is fresh, bright, and quirky.  I loved the white plates with sunny yellow borders, the oversized yellow coffee cups, the denim-looking napkins, and the lime green couch with navy border at the entrance.  The lower part of the seating area overlooks the beautiful pool.\n\nOverall, quite disappointing, especially for the price.",

    "text": "My husband and I were on our way to the Tempe Sports Complex to play in my work softball tournament and needed to find a place to get a fast, hearty, and affordable lunch. We had originally planned to go to the Mongolian BBQ place nearby (called YC's, I think) but pulled in and realized that it would probably take too long to do the whole pick your meats, veggies, and sauce thing (we only had 20 minutes or so to get lunch and get to the field). That was when we spotted Gandolfo's and decided to give it a try. \n\nThe menu was huge and really overwhelming, especially since we were in a hurry, but we both just picked something and ordered. He chose the New Yorker (roast beef sandwich served hot with pepper jack, feta, lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperoncini, butter, mayo, and oil and vinegar) and I got the Knickerbocker (which had roast beef, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, oil & vinegar, and salt & pepper) served hot. \n\nAfter we paid, we ended up waiting quite a while for our sandwiches  to be prepared, especially given how few people were inside. I probably wouldn't return during a weekday lunch knowing that it's not super-speedy. If you are planning to go there for lunch, make sure it's on a day where you don't need to grab your food and be back ASAP. Maybe calling ahead would help in that case. \n\nAlso, even though the sandwiches were definitely satisfying,  they weren't outstanding. My husband, who's originally from New Jersey, didn't think the sandwiches were nearly as good as ones he's had on the East Coast. And, yes, I know we're in Phoenix, but the restaurant (which is a chain, btw) has chosen to call itself \"New York Delicatessen,\" which in all fairness, can raise a customer's expectations! I also thought the regular size of the sandwich was a bit small. If you are a big eater, I would definitely get the large. Lest you think all I have to say about Gandolfo's sandwiches is negative, I will spend a second praising the hero roll the sandwiches came on, which was freshly baked and super satisfying. \n\nI would definitely eat at Gandolfo's again if I were in the area and had time to wait for a sandwich, but I'm unlikely to go out of my way for it.",

Who wants to buy something in a pawn shop prior to going to dinner? INtriguing?  Enticing?  Elegant interior design throughout! Nice bar too but very small.  \nIt was opening so they were very overstaffed. It feels a bit bizarre because there is no room in the kitchen for the staff to stand around. They just camp out by your tables.  Service was impeccable for that reason!  Appetizers were spot on delicious but our pork chops very chewy, fatty, and we had to send them back.  The manager was fabulous though, very apologetic and brought out a tenderloin that was to die for, sliced thin and cooked to perfection.  We will go back.",

The best part was the made-to-order grill.  Delicious omelets with fresh veges, french toast, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and actual eggs were all made fresh in front of your eyes.\n2) Well stocked gym.  It had many treadmills and ellipticals.  Free weights were also available which is kinda rare in hotels these days.\n3) Shuttle bus was free and the driver could take you anywhere in a 3 mile radius including the airport.  He was even kind enough to pick me up at the baseball stadium even though it was out of the operating range.\n\nCons:\n1) $5 / day parking fee.\n2) My room smelled like the guy before smoked in there\n3) The hot water in the shower took forever to heat up.  It was about 5 minutes, no joke.  I could've sworn the hotel ran out of hot water.\n4) The card key readers were finicky at best.  It took at least 3 tries before I was able to open my door.  Pulling it out at different speeds didn't matter\n5) The internet was also finicky.  First of all it was not free except for Hilton Gold and above members.  The internet wasn't fast and the connection would die quite often.  The wifi was so weak in the bedroom that I gave up trying to use it in there.\n6) Very little counter top space at the bathroom sink.",

They brought out the seared tuna appetizer... did not order that... asked one of the bartenders what this was... it was not the salad so he took it back... then the original bartender came over to apologize.. fine whatever, but could you please ask the kitchen to put the herb dressing and ginger dressing on the side. He said sure and walked back to the kitchen... \n\nOk, still waiting... finally it comes out. The salad looked lovely and fresh-really beautiful. The dressing were good (not great), but what ruined my lunch was the tuna... a piece was put on my plate that you couldn't even knife through.. WTF, this is the second time... If I had put that in my mouth, I would have lost it... I am so picky about my sushi... REALLY... the first time this happened with the salmon and now the tuna... \n\nOk, so Meghan, the ultra cool manager was not there, instead it was some shitty manager. I brought the cut of meat to his attention, he apologized but reluctantly. \n\nThat really blows... he blows... do I really ever want to go back... probably not. Well at least not for the sushi... I know better than to order sushi so far from the ocean. \n\nSorry Cowfish... your sushi grade fish blows. Or your staff for allowing that on a plate (TWICE).",

Last night I got my chance.  Though it was the day-of, we still managed to secure a reservation, maybe because it was a Tuesday night.  On the phone, we got a very similar speech to the one we got when making reservations at Lee.  They will only holding the table for 15 minutes and you can only stay for two hours.  Okay fine.\n\nWe got there five minutes early and were quickly shown to our table for four.  The rest of the party arrived late, but we had ordered drinks, so no one seemed too concerned.  I ordered the apple cider and took a minute to take in the sights.  I liked the quirky interior... Victorian family portrait with one family member wearing a Stormtrooper mask - I'm feeling it.  Watching the chefs working away was fairly interesting too, though it really didn't help with the noise factor.  Even the trip to the loo was a little bit of an adventure what with all the corner turning and so on.\n\nThe food was a hit and a little miss though I really appreciated the eclectic menu.  I was lucky enough that everyone was both really hungry hence ordering a lot but also very willing to share!  The truffle oil popcorn was incredible, the tuna salad was meh,  the calamari a bit disappointing, the curried shrimp and naan very decent, the croquettes passable though I wouldn't order them again, the Fior di latte + mushrooms + truffle oil + spinach was amazing, the Burrata + pesto + eggplant + roasted red peppers was alright, and the beef hotplate was just okay.\n\nThis was not a cheap meal, but I must confess, in addition to the many dishes we tried, we also have two bottles of wine on the bill.  Will I return?  I think I'll wait until summer so I can enjoy their lovely patio, but yes, I think I will.",

    "text": "I chose WhatAPup to help socialize my 8 week old basset hound. I was able to enrol in the Puppy Socialization class which was an incredibly easy process. Caryn makes it possible to pay for classes online as well as manage your schedule online. So the flexibility of the courses was a really great feature for us as our schedule is very inconsistent. \n\nWe're graduated now but our experience here was memorable to say the least! The puppy social class offered exactly what it stated. The room was very clean and well organized. The instructors were very helpful in answering our questions about my puppies behaviour issues I had been experiencing. Caryn is extremely sweet and you can tell she really loves what she does! The male instructor (Sean I believe his name was?) was one of our favourites! He always seemed to have the perfect treat for our puppy that made her pretty much grovel at his feet!!!!!! Something I thought she'd never have the attention span to do! All instructors had a very pleasant demeanour and seem knowledgable even to your specific breed (impressive)! They gave me a great feel on what to expect when my basset was able to go into the real world and how to encourage good behaviour. \n\nThe only complain I would make would be about the facility itself.. It's very industrial and I'd like them to be able to expand their business into something maybe more inviting? (The building is a bit sketchy on the outside) but the experience was more than I could ask for. I will be enrolling in more classes in the future thats for sure!!",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):\n1 star:  Never again.\n2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.\n3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.\n4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.\n5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.\n\nI do not believe the Southern food here is as subtle or \"elegant\" as Okra.  The food here is more down-home and hearty, with some very good dishes and a couple that were not good, but I give extra props to Chef Beckett for hosting specialty dinners and making those nights quite memorable.\n\nI will start with the one glaring negative, and it was the gumbo.  Came for lunch and ordered the gumbo with smoked chicken and grilled andouille.  It was not good.  It lacked the depth of flavor that seafood adds to a gumbo and apart from an overwhelming smoke flavor, there was another off flavor in it that I did not enjoy.  Before this, I ordered the dirty rice balls and these were tasty.  Above average, not mind-blowing, but tasty.\n\nMy wife and I also came for two special event dinners here, and like I said, much respect to Chef for hosting.  We came to Fowl Out night for the 7 Chefs Series, and I know Chef Beckett didn't prepare mos of the dishes that night, but it came from his kitchen and the food and service were all phenomenal.  (Except, interestingly, Chef Campbell's hot chicken, which was big but not spicy or flavorful enough.)  Chef Beckett did prepare a smoked duck confit dish that night with dijon spaetzle, garlic chard, and cracklins - this dish was excellent.\n\nThe other specialty dinner was to celebrate Chef Sean Brock's new cookbook Heritage.  With recipes from the book, Chef Beckett did not disappoint, turning out dish after dish that were not just evocative of Chef Brock's style and ethos, but spot-on renditions.  My wife and I would know, since we've dined at both Husk and McCrady's.  I would say Chef Beckett's fried chicken skins that night surpassed the chicken skins we had at Husk.\n\nAs to the regular menu, the fried green tomatoes are very good, with the pea tendrils an extra plus tot his dish.  The fried okra is serviceable.  The greens were cooked enough (maybe a tad over-cooked),  and both the cider brined pork loin and catfish are quite good.  \n\nSo like I said, slight preference for Okra.  But don't fail to miss a special dinner night at Southern Rail.  Those nights tend towards the amazing.",

It was empty when we walked in, we got to pick and choose the table we wanted. The waiter was very nice, she gave us water right away and waited for us to make up are mind.  I did noticed a lot of orders over the phone. They were very busy with all the phone orders. \n\nWe decided to try the pork wontons, Mongolian beef, sizzling rice with shrimp, low main with chicken and vegetables. They give you complementary egg drop soup and it's delicious. I liked everything I had, except for the sizzling rice. It was ok, I'm was not crazy about. It might just be me but not my favorite. However; everything else we had it was great. The best part is that it's very inexpensive and delicious. We paid $34.32 including 3 sodas. We will be back to try some of the other items on the menu.",

    "text": "Ok, now it's time to talk a little bit about their brunch!  We went for dinner, which was my first review. Dinner was excellent, but on our way in we noticed a sign for their brunch specials on the weekend. Brunch is perhaps my favorite meal of the day, so it was decided --- Mundo brunch for my birthday :-)\n\nWe had a table of 6 I think, and were one of only a couple groups in the whole place. I'd love to see this place stay, so I'm hoping more of you will give it a try!\n\nSo first things first. Bottomless drinks. For $20 you get either bloody marys or mimosas (in several flavors far more interesting than just OJ). Our server gave us the great idea of one person ordering one, the other ordering the other, and we could mix-match to our hearts desire! Genius since I love bloody marys, but bottomless could weigh you down after awhile. \n\nFood - I got the Benedict Mexicano --- DELISH.\nJalapeno corn bread instead of english muffin.\nPork carnitas instead of canadian bacon/ham.\nGreen chile hollandaise instead of normal heavy hollandaise. \nGenius. It was so good, it makes me wonder why Mr. Benedict didn't just make it this way from the beginning.  \n\nNormally I have order envy, where no matter how happy I am with what I order, I covet what my neighbors have. Not this time. I didn't want to trade, I didn't want to share.  I can't even tell you what the other 5 people at my table ordered, but they all loved it too, so I don't think you can go wrong :)",

It was so overcooked you could not pierce it with a fork or cut it with a knife.  It looked like freeze dried dog treats- I wish I had taken a picture.  I did not bring it back, I ate around it and will never to back. I also overheard the workers in the back talk about one of the customers.  The employees preparing the food do not wear hair nets. Most of the employees we have encountered are very nice- but because we don't know what we are going to get with the food we won't eat here again.

    "text": "After hearing buzz about this place for sometime, decided to finally pony up to the bar and see what the fuss was about!\n\nWalking into this place, you can tell it's ideally set up to handle the uptown lunch rush.  Plenty of space between the tables, is a great plus.  Even at the peak times, you can have a meal without being jostled and still be able to hear yourself think!\n\nThis is where it went downhill.  First timers here will be confused when they are handed a card, menu and wished the best of luck.  Good thing I was lunching it with two veterans.  They showed me the ropes behind the self-service concept (I assume this was supposed to be the charge of the girl at the register, but she wasn't interested).  I ordered a special off the board.  It was billed as pasta with pan fried ham, french blue cheese, arugula, and garlic. What I got was a bit different.\n\nThe chef started out by pan frying the ham.  All 4 little cubes of it.  Added the blue cheese (again, missed the portion of cheese I was supposed to get by a WIDE margin).  In what I can only assume was a little kitchen creative liberty, he then substituted spinach for the arugula (spinach = inferior greenery to the almighty arugula).  Finished off the pan sauce with not even enough of a ladle of cream to get the spinach wet!  That's OK though, because his plan all along, I guess, was to add the requisite moisture by not completely straining the pasta from the water before adding it to the pan.  End result was a bland, underseasoned bowl of pasta (and little else) sitting in water.  No bueno.  Accompanying this disappointment was bread (VERY good and fresh baked, actually) and a side salad which was served in a dish big enough to hold 4 pieces of lettuce and one crouton.  \n\n$20 out the door (whaaaaa?).  This place is like a hibachi grill.  You aren't paying for good food.  You're paying for the entertainment of cook to order and ambiance.  Except no one juggles knives in this place.  Luce still reigns supreme for Uptown Italian, both in quality and value, by a country mile.",

But from what I hear, their business concept is interesting, and their website forwards to a church website every Sunday. \n\nNow, what I can review is the food; I decided to be not-so-adventurous and opted for the cheeseburger. Here's a breakdown:\n\nBurger Buns: comparable to McDonalds in size, smaller than the Burger King Whopper.\n\nInside: pick and choose ... I don't go fancy so I had ketchup, mayo, lettuce and tomato. Some other choices? Mustard, onions, pickles, pepper, etc.\n\nPatty: nice and crumbly homemade patty, good flavours. Nice consistency! \n\nCheese: the good stuff. Doesn't taste cheap, doesn't taste like cardboard.\n\nFilling? My colleagues usually order 2-3 burgers each... I usually get just 1 because I like it light. It's definitely a lot lighter than your usual burgers.\n\nSides: fries? I hear the fries aren't that great. But haven't had them, so no comment. \n\nPrice: a burger is about $5.99; that's inexpensive for a nice gourmet burger. \n\nThat's it, folks! Best burger ever.",

The service has been nice and friendly, but the food is not very good and not worth the money. \n\nThe burgers were super overcooked and dry. It was as if the patties had been sitting on a grill for too long, and they were way too small for the buns. The cheese was a cold kraft single. For the price, you're better off going somewhere like Peter's. \n\nThe regular fries are okay - they're just frozen McCain crinkle cut, but they were fresh and hot with a nice seasoning spice on them, though a bit dry. However, I seriously would recommend staying away from the chilli cheese fries - covered in gross nacho cheese and left me feeling really bad in my stomach.",

Unfortunately, this did not turn into one of those occasions where we miraculously discovered our new favourite dinner spot. \n\nOur first impressions of La Piazzetta was pretty good; the interior was decorated nicely, and the waiter was friendly and attentive when we walked in. However, after we were seated, it look about 10 minutes to get water and another 10 minutes - after signalling - to get our order placed. There were maybe three or four other tables, so I don't understand the slow service.\n\nFood-wise, this place is nothing spectacular. We ordered a brioche for our appetizer, which was probably the best part of the meal, but it wasn't something that we couldn't recreate at home. My main course, the $17 cheese fondue stuffed pizza(?) was tasteless and small. The side salad was okay. My friend said her Margherita pizza could be found in the freezer section of Provigo. \n\nHonestly, if it were less expensive, this place might've fared better - but I'm not in the habit of paying $30 for a mediocre meal.",

    "text": "In the age old war between Zaba's and Chipotle, Zaba's always wins out for me.  So much so that while the Eastern location which is closest to me is closed down in preparation of a new location opening soon, I drove all the way to this location instead of just settling for the Chipotle down the street.   That's partially not true as I was somewhat in the area before deciding to get some take-out for lunch, but it was definitely much less convenient than going the Chipotle route and dammit I still took it.\n\nThis location seemed much nicer aesthetically than any other Zaba's I've been to.   That's not to say that they usually aren't nice because they are, but something about this one just seemed a step ahead.   It was packed for lunch but the employees were on top of their game in within a few minutes I was out the door with a couple Zaba Bowls to go.   \n\nI did my usual, a zaba bowl with brown rice, shredded beef, corn, green salsa, and lettuce.   It's about as healthy a meal I can put together at any of these fresh-mex joints that I can still enjoy.   I found it to be a good version of the same thing I've gotten 100 times at the Eastern location.   The shredded beef was nicely spiced (I've had it on occasion lack spiciness which I believe is due to it not being stewed long enough to soak it all in) and the veggies were fresh and as tasty as veggies can be.   My rice was a little mushier than I normally like it, so that was my only minor gripe.   I also shared a bag of chips and they were spot on as usual.   \n\nA good value became even better recently with the introduction of the Zaba's reward card with which every 10 entrees purchased you get the 11th free.   Points are doubled on Sundays.   Since I go to the other location at least 2-3 times a week and buy for 2, I average a free entree every 2-3 weeks.   WHAT HAS CHIPOTLE DONE FOR ME LATELY?   Exactly.",

From greasy, gut rot Bertos, to central Mexico and New Mexican authentic, to high class more fancy Mex in Scottsdale. I love all types of regional Mexican fare.\n\nThis place sits nicely in the middle of grease and Scottsdale.  No drive through but you do order from a counter.  The nice part is that if you eat in, your food comes on a actual plate and the guy behind the counter will actually bring it to you with real silverware.\n\nBeen here a few time and each time was very good, and cheap to boot.  I recommend the Caminero burro.  Solid beans and salsa too.\n\nJust a nice little family owned spot with a menu similar to most Mexican places with the assortment of burros, enchiladas and tacos.  They just do it a little better here than most places and certainly WAY BETTER than the ripoff, joke of a Mexican restaurant across the street, Top Shelf.\n\nLaugh as you leave and look across the street at Top Shelf.

I was in town for a conference, so this hotel was perfect for meeting up with colleagues and for the ease of going to the meetings and then back to my room to rest up. I highly recommend Westgate if you're not needing to be in the middle of the Strip (not walking distance), and if you're at the Conference Center for business. I would not recommend it as a romantic getaway or as a replacement for any of the more \"themed\" hotel/casinos that Vegas is known for. Westgate is a straight-up hotel/casino. No special frills, no theme, no story, no fanciness. It is affordable and a good idea to say hotel moneys in Vegas. The staff at the front desk was super friendly (which I really appreciate). The person checking me in (at 1am) was great to talk to and even upgraded me to a large room at the 28th (out of 29) floor, just so I could have a better view. It was an appreciated gesture and one I will continue to praise. The quality of the room, however, left to be desired... It had obviously not been updated in years (shades of brown, low ceilings, broken bathroom fan, one of the two heaters was broken and only blowing cold air, rust around all bathroom fixtures and broken coffee table in the living room). Colleagues in other rooms, reported their bathrooms being dirty (I did not experience this). With a little remodel love, this could be a great hotel. Nonetheless, I had a good time. THX!",

I waited at least 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated, as the host was no where to be found.  Not a great first impression for a first time customer.  \n\nWe were seated and were promptly brought out water and menus.  Since I always get the green curry, Thai hot, and my daughter always orders the chicken skewers, we put out order in before other people had even ordered.  I requested that both dishes come out at the same time since she was eating an appetizer as an entr??e.  Her order was brought out 15 minutes later, and mine came out a good 10 minutes after that.   Let me say that I was less than happy, since other tables that ordered well after I did were already being served.  \n\nThe curry was good, but was not the best that I've had.  Lacking eggplant if you ask me, but the amount of vegetables was great.  They did Thai spice very well too, as it cleared my sinuses in no time flat.  The portions are very large, definitely enough to share or bring home for another large meal the next day.  The chicken skewers were decent, cold by the time my dish came out though, so my (very picky) daughter hardly touched them after that.\n\nAs for the staff, let's just say their personalities were literally the most bland I've ever experienced.  Christ almighty, couldn't get a smile out of any of them...and I'm quite pleasant and fun!  They all seemed like they hated their job, hated life, and at any moment one of them would pull a 12 gauge from the back and start picking off staff and customers before ending it all!  \n\nNot sure if I would come back here...the restaurant is beautiful, the food is pretty good, but aside from the great ambiance, it was lacking, to say the least.  Plus, they play terrible indie electronica music, which, between you and I, makes me think I should be in a gay bar, rather than an upscale Thai restaurant.\n\nEat here or don't, but you can get better service, food, in almost as pretty of a restaurant that plays authentic Thai music over @ Siam Thai (50th and northern).",

For various reasons, we ended up not going until yesterday...a Friday afternoon...and it was not a good scene. \n\nFirst of all, there was no one up front manning the counter so we had to wait...and wait...and wait for someone to come seat us. The restaurant was not busy but for some reason waiting seemed to be the theme of the day. When we were finally seated, we ordered drinks which took an excessively long period of time to get. Then we had to wait some more for our server took our order. She only came over after I went over to another server to ask for some help. Had I not been with my Dad, I would have left. He seemed OK with the waiting but it was 40 minutes before our order was taken...and again, it was NOT busy.  That's just unacceptable. It was another 30 minutes after we ordered for our food to come. So it was well over an hour from the time we sat down to the time our food came and we didn't order anything complicated....a couple of hot sandwiches! And when our food finally did come...it was COLD! I was SO annoyed. I mentioned it to the cashier and he just said oh I'm sorry to hear that. Ugh.\n\nLast time we ever go here again.

We realized that despite paying $100/mo we had lots of bugs and insects in our home. We started to observe the \"technician\" they were sending out and discovered they basically did nothing but wipe down the frames of the windows with a roller? \nSo we cancelled. Got written email confirmation our service has been cancelled. They've come three times since then, and charged us for all 3 times despite not wanting service and cancelling. We haven't paid but they're threatening to go to debt collectors so I guess it's against our credit now. \n\nSo, unless you want to pay them until the end of time to not treat your house, I would never use them.",

At the time I worried he was too young to be there but I was quickly proven wrong as he developed at lightening speed!  His communication skills improved remarkably fast and the staff taught me that he was capable of much more than I realized.  He is now almost two and can recite his ABCs, count to 20, uses sign language, carries his own food tray, drinks freely from regular cups & even cleans up after himself.  It is 100% due to the expertise and Montessori trained staff at SpringStone.  Their program exposes children to many stimulating activities and subjects from math and science to music, dance and art!  He loves going to school and is in great hands with the caring teachers and staff at SpringStone.  Our kiddo has thrived and we couldn't be happier with his well rounded and continuous development.",

No paper required. I hate to sound cheap, but these days, thrift stores are pricey. $7 for a pair of trousers that have been who knows where on who knows who doing who knows what? For this reason (and because of the smell), I had sworn off thrifting. \n\nAlas, being highly vulnerable to pop culture recommendations (Rihanna is, after all, why I drank Jameson for a month), I followed Macklemore on a Thriftshop adventure with a pal in tow. This was our second stop.\n\nIt is relatively organized, and it didn't smell stale. Prices were as anticipated a bit higher than I hoped. However, what I do like about Epic is that if you go to their Facebook they have specials every day of the week. For example, next Saturday everything is 50% off! That's the day to go. \n\nI didn't end up buying anything here or even being tempted by anything, which was a tad disappointing, but they had some interesting highlights: a homemade washer game in the home goods department and quite an impressive record collection. I didn't check the condition of the records, but the covers alone are priceless. Worth mentioning: Rufus and Olivia Newton John. Plus, my pal couldn't resist a 6-cassette tape series on \"The Psychology of Achievement.\" She has a casette player in her car. How inspiring.",

I had regular twice monthly cleanings for almost a year. 4 stars instead of 5 because they do sometimes arrive outside the window, but I believe it says on their site that this can happen when other jobs take longer than they expect. It's not been a huge issue for us because we both work from home. The other reason for the 4 stars is because sometimes they would miss wiping down the kitchen/bathroom cabinets, which is something we'd paid extra for above and beyond our bi-weekly service rate. Although, I'm never sure if that is because I didn't make sure to remind them or what. But otherwise they could not be nicer and I loved the job they did every time. I wish we could afford to keep doing it! Unfortunately, when things get tight this is one of those luxuries that has to go first. :(",

I don't know if it's the air or the angle of the sun as it sets relative to the park's geographic location. I can't quite pin point the one imperfection that makes it not a 5/5. Maybe its because there isn't a water fountain or public restroom or even a port a john. Maybe it's not 5/5 because the banister on the central gazebo is slightly askew.

We ordered 1 lbs of baby spice shrimp butter garlic, 1 lbs of lemon pepper medium, 1 lbs of lemon pepper medium with corn, 3 rice, 2 waters,  and 1 unsweetened tea. First she brought me raspberry tea, corrected her it was unsweetened tea, brought it to me with sugar on the side. Smh.

And while I felt pretty grumpy about it for awhile, a friend and I discovered this great tea place. And I am so glad I did. There are a lot of reasons why it's a great place.\n1. The tea! The selection is huge. There are so many kinds to chose from, non-caffeinated, caffeinated, blends, white, roobios, black, green, chai, fruit and on and on and on. They'll make it hot or cold or even blended up with fruit like a smoothie. \n2. The knowledge. I'm pretty new to the tea scene (coffee-addict, remember?) so I know very little about the different teas, what pairs well together and what kind I like. I asked a ton of questions and the guy ( I think it was the owner, super friendly) answered them all patiently, let me smell the different teas and offered his suggestions. I got an iced Calypso Green Tea with coconut milk and it really surprised me how much I reallllllly liked it. Kudos PuraTea.\n3. All their teas (loose-leaf) can be purchased by the ounce and the prices are fantastic!\n4. They have alternative milks - I had their coconut milk, no sugar added and I think they have one other choice. They use honey as their sweetener if you want it sweet. \n5. The space. It's nothing special from the outside but the inside is very cozy. Games, books, puzzles and a lot of seating to sit and just hang out. Which is what we did! \n\nQuiet and real chill place. Can't say enough good things. I'm looking forward to making all the different teas I bought. You can tell they really love tea and have a passion for what they are doing and that sure makes a big difference.",

There's a refrigerator case stocked with bagel-angled groceries: many varieties of cream cheese, two or three of capers, half a dozen smoked salmon options, and several salmon spreads; a few jams, butter, and some stuff we failed to note. There's another small refrigerator with non-alcoholic drinks. \n\nThe drawback is that the bagels suck. \n\n\"Suck\" is too strong, but we'd been advised that Montr??al's bagel scene rivals New York's, and that turns out to be a lunatic's delusion. In flavor, this dough isn't far from a simple street pretzel. What a street pretzel has that these bagels lack, of course, is a thick pelt of salt. Any flavor you get at St. Viateur comes from that refrigerator. The bagels give you a warm smooshy vessel for salmon, cheese, jam, etc., thus fulfilling only the most rudimentary function of a bagel. \n\nIt was late, though; we had played a show and everything else was closed; and so we fell onto the St. Viateur bagels like half-starved hyenas stumbling across an unguarded scrum of newborn kittens (must happen sometimes). Given the strictly-takeout nature of the spot, that meant huddling around a tiny ersatz picnic blanket of paper bags on the sidewalk out front, scooping and spreading cream cheese and sawing salmon with little plastic knives no stiffer than stir sticks. \n\nThere's something attractive about the rudimetary nature of these bagels. Like inchoate little vertebrates crawling out of the sea on their journey to articulated limbs and teeth and wings, St. Viateur's product arouses in the modern mammal an instinctive gratitude. That's not to say, though, we'd ever elect willingly to shed our teeth and thumbs, our poppy seeds and garlic and swirls of pumpernickel.",

Last time, my wife and I sat at the \"chefs bar\" and chatted with Darren most of the night, was a great experience and really cool to gain some insight to a very fast moving little kitchen with a focus on quality and consistency. Saw more than a few dishes not make the pass as Darren inspected every dish before handing over to ensure it was absolutely perfect. Food was ridiculous good, drinks also very good although I would maybe like to see one more rotating local tap. Prices are not cheap, but quality is top notch and I certainly left feeling that I got all of my moneys worth.  \n\nFor god sake folks please don't ask for soy sauce with the sushi, its all pre-dressed, this isn't Kinjo. \n\nWill definitely go back (can't wait).",

Don't expect anything fancy. \n\nOne thing to watch for is that pop isn't included although the ayce menu said so. We were charged $1.50 for pop with refills when the bill came.

I came back in a few weeks later to get my oil changed and was shown that color chart for brake fluid and was told it was awful and the price to have my brake fluid flushed...  I asked the guy why they would not have done that when replacing the brakes and he fumbled over his words and told me they would do it free of charge.  At the end he claimed that sometimes there will be residue after they clean out the brakes and that is what had happened...  Do not trust these people!

Dr. Baht did the most thorough exam I've witnessed and has all the high tech equipment at his disposal. We ordered glasses at the initial appointment and Dr. said he would do some research on the appropriate contacts and call us back to try some. We went back to pick up the glasses (they're Tag Heuer-made in France-very nice) the next week and tried the contacts on. Dr. Baht hit the nail on the head right outta the gate. The glasses are perfect and the contacts, although the manufacturer doesn't make as many sizes as they could, are working very well for both distance and close up vision. Very impressive - we expected the need to return to try multiple types so were pleasantly surprised. The office is modern and comfortable. Great selection of eye glasses and sunglasses. Staff is friendly and efficient. We are happy to have an eye Dr. and a team who are proficient and personable close to home. Don't hesitate to go to this eye doctor! Top notch.",

Right away, my boo and I ordered glasses of beers while we enjoyed some bread and gherkins and waited to place our orders. \nWe ordered our wine (Le St. Chinian), entr??es -- both got onglets done medium rare. The cuts were small according to my partner (he's a big boy = big appetite) but I thought it was perfection. The fries were divine as well, while my boy got mashed potatoes (he has a peanut allergy and they do deep fry their fries in peanut oil) which he thoroughly enjoyed. \n\nEverything was beyond delicious but my favourite part was definitely dessert. We got the cheese cake and I honestly believe that it is the best cheese cake I have ever eaten in my life. That and my cappuccino and we had ourselves a perfect evening over a delicious, unforgetful meal. \n\nThe service was prompt and very friendly, yet remained very professional. I honestly have no complaints about L'Express. The only one thing I have to say is why is it so good? I have to go back sooner than later now! haha!

    "text": "The pork bone soup is not the best but I still like it. One thing I don't like about the pork bone soup is that's no protein. It's like eating a soup with a bone in it. There's hardly meat at all. Well on bright side meat is unhealthy especially pork so I tend to think oh well I ate less of  bad thing. . \nI came here with my sis 2 am in the morning it was fun experience lol... there were other people as well so it wasn't awkward. the pork bone soup tasted better than when we ate at lunch or dinner for some reason.  ( we weren't drunk for one thing) I think if there are less orders in the restaurant the food tends to be better.\n\n I recommend this place XD",

It's even worth a special trip for the various bands/events/televised football (soccer) games. \nI think I've seen more selfies taken in their washrooms posted than from any other area pub. They are decorated pretty cool!\n\nAs mentioned, the pints feature a great selection of both difficult to find imports and domestic items. \n\nThe vegan food options, although limited, are available. I had the vegan shepherds pie and thought it was fantastic. Fairly priced and well presented, along with accompanying side salad. I was stuffed!\n\nThe service was friendly and competent. \n\nWill be back. Again and again.",

    "text": "Ugh.  Where do I start?\n\nI stayed at the Tropicana on a quick weekend trip to Vegas for a convention that was next door at the MGM Grand.  The Grand wanted $300 a night thanks to a Def Leppard concert going on that weekend but the dear, sweet Tropicana was selling rooms for a mere $85 a night.  What a deal I thought, only to find out the old adage \"you get what you pay for\" is true.\n\nI wanted to like the Tropicana for pure nostalgia reasons.  The hotel is one of the last Vegas originals still hanging on and was a prime spot back in the Sinatra days so when I got to my room in the Island Tower I tried to close my eyes and pretend like I didn't see the white stains all over the couch and desk chair.  Or the brown stains on the sofa.  Or the bamboo styled bed that had a mirror going up the wall and over the bed.  Truth be told my room had a smell that I couldn't place.  The entire experience was a mysterious adventure with suspect results.\n\nTo get to the Island Tower you have to walk down a very long corridor with many vendors selling cheap knock offs of mostly glitter tops and light up buttons, cheap jewelry and hair extensions.  They have a buffet that serves fatty prime rib and french toast; luckily it is all you can eat.\n\nThe Tropicana is located at the end of the strip near MGM Grand, New York, New York and Mandalay Bay.  You should stay here for cheap cost and location.  Expect nothing from the casino and hold your nose.",

We didnt have to ask for water refills as the water goblets were filled at one half full. \n\nThe interiors is very classy and old world Europe. The waiters had a suit on which added to its ambiance. The clientele, however, was a bit too casual for my taste on that particular evening. I was expecting dressy and stuffy. But I got shirts and shorts. But as it is Vegas and summer, I guess I was expecting too much. Some people were dressy so it balanced out my expectation for that evening. \n\nWith Zin in our hands, it was time to finally order. They have a limited but good\nmenu. Not a lot of variety, but I prefer quality over quantity so I was perfectly fine with the menu. After putting on our order, we had to wait for a long while to get our actual orders.  \n\nBeing a French restaurant and as with everything in France, it took \"forever\" to get our meal. Although after the first bite, we were all convinced that the food was really good and that it was the right restaurant for the whole family to enjoy on a Friday night on a Vegas weekend getaway.\n\nOur bill for a family of 8 was $$$ and nearing $$$$. No one paid attention and were all in agreement that it was worth it. \n\nSo I would recommend this restaurant for casual yet elegant dining.",

    "text": "I stopped here today to pick up dinner. First impression: very clean, nicely set up dining area, very friendly young staff. I ordered Mu-shu Shrimp (not on the menu but the chef did it at my request with no issue). Also ordered BBQ Pork appetizer, Crab Rangoons and Pot Stickers.\nThe Mu-shu Shrimp was very fresh with all the shredded cabbage, mushrooms, etc- stir fried and flavorful. A nice surprise because I haven't had good Chinese food since I moved to AZ in 1998. \nThe BBQ Pork was delicious!!! Tender, juicy, sliced and presented so well even in the take out box! Some of the best BBQ pork I've had in years!\nPot Stickers were a little on the blah side, simply for lack of seasoning in the meat filling. If there were more filling that was a bit more seasoned they would be better. I found them to be a bit overdone. \nThe Crab Rangoons, big kudos to this restaurant for actually mixing crab in with the cream cheese!!! Now, I don't know if it's real crab or imitation because it was so blended together, but I was impressed. Also, the wonton wrapper used is very thin so these are a bit lighter than the usual Deep fried cheese that most places give us. \nOverall, a very good takeout experience. They make Peking Duck there, so I will be back to dine there and try it. I am a HUGE Peking Duck fan!! \nThis place is a nice change from the heavy, greasy, gross Panda Express, Yan's type places that deep fry almost everything as is usual with Americanized Chinese food (that we all know is not real Chinese food)... There are no crab Rangoons in chinese restaurants in china. Duh. I think people will enjoy this better (while not authentic) option on the west side.",

I found on arriving at the terminal there was little signage or instruction on what I should do so I waited in line to see an employee. In the end she told me because I had booked and printed online I didn't need to do anything so to just take my bag outside and wait. The seat was comfortable enough. There was wifi and an electrical outlet. Boarding is a cluster-. There aren't really signs to tell you where to be and people kind of spill out of lines into areas the busses have to pull into. The only major annoyance was that the trip took an extra two hours each way due to boarder delays but that's not the bus line's fault. All in all, I'd do it again. Way cheaper than flying and not as terrible as the gossip would have you believe.",

We were pleasantly surprised at what was behind the shiny exterior of this hidden treasure in Cleveland Heights. In fact, I would say that we were elated upon finding this place.\n\nI would surmise there are perhaps two different experiences in this restaurant with regard to atmosphere and service as well as time of day visited. I am surprised the overall rating for this place isn't higher. \n\nFirst off, the bartenders here are superior in their creations of cocktails.They are masters of mixology and to watch them create is a pleasure itself.  The offerings are quite exquisite. I am so happy they have absinthe and chartreuse!  The GINNTANG drink is beautiful and sooooo delicious! The menu lists a pitcher of ABSINTHE if you are daring enough to order such an extravagance. This is on my list of future \"to do's\" as I look forward to a night of hallucinations and bizarre dreaming (if you have ever had absinthe, you will know what I mean)!!!\n \nThe food is very good!  Everything we have tried so far has been perfect. The Katz Club sandwich was beautifully presented and oh so tasty! The Vegan Curried Lentil Soup is unique in flavor.  The Spinach and Frisee salad was also very good and has fresh, crisp ingredients. Add the chicken to the salad and it will deliver a smooth, smoky overall flavor to the dish. We even had room for a piece of their birthday cake which was \"melt in your mouth\" texture and deliciously sweet in the right way. \n\nThe bar car has such a cool vibe and the lighting gives it such a sexy ambiance. They had soft R&B playing in the background which we love so much. I truly feel happy and relaxed when I am sitting in this hideaway. I have to say that I find this place to be one of my absolute favorites in the area. \n\nI highly recommend the Katz Club Diner to anyone who is looking for a relaxed, slower paced evening where you want to enjoy a special libation and delicious food in a \"speak easy\" environment.",

College boys with hot girlfriends sitting at cocktail tables with their heads cocked to the side watching lame TV shows.  They have dialog TV, not music videos.  It felt kinda like having beers with friends at a chess tournament instead of a bar...I asked the bartender if they could put some music on.  He said, \"Yes,\" but 15 minutes later there still wasn't any.  \n\nSo I brought my guitar in and started a sing-along with my group of friends who were with me.  Several people throughout the bar came over and started singing with us.  Someone even bought my 3 beers before my tab came.  It seems management doesn't understand that part of a Friday night bar scene, is music.  \n\nI advise to drop the dry dialog non-funny TV shows.  Unless perhaps no music is their bar niche.  I guess there are those who don't like music.  Of course singing our own songs for 45 minutes at the top of our lungs was a blast for my group. Not sure how they felt about it, but they didn't kick us out.",

    "text": "I love 9 round!  This is a great concept to add to any fitness routine, especially if you are one that suffers from being \"bored\" while working out.     \n\nSo, just like the name states, you have 9 rounds to complete in 30 minutes.  Each round is 3 minutes and there is a 30 second \"active rest\" inbetween rounds.  Each round combines cardio, core and strength so you are ensured a total body workout.  This is somewhat of a \"kickboxing fusion\" concept so at a few of the rounds you put your boxing gloves on and go to town on a punching bag!  It is actually quite refreshing and a great way to release tension after a long day at work!  \n\nThe stations change every day so you are constantly \"tricking\" your body which is a great way to see results.  You will  see a variety of moves like jump roping, squats, burpees, planks, roundhouse kicks, various punches, pushups, dips, etc\n\nThis is a great place for all fitness levels.  The trainers challenge you along the way or they can modify if you have any injuries.  Everyone is super nice, the music is fun and the workout is awesome!!  Give them a try!  This is a very affordable way to get a very personalized workout that will meet all fitness goals!",

    "text": "One of the worst experiences I have ever had with a company.  We arrived at the agency at the Venetian  in Las Vegas. Our first complaint was that there was absolutely no one at the counter along with no sign posted when they would be back. So after 30 aggravating minutes, the representative decided to do her job and return to work. She was not very friendly and was very short with us. She did not explain many options that we could add on for the car. After all this, she informed us \"we were receiving a free upgrade\". When we walked to our car, we walked to a Nissan Versa. This was no upgrade. On top of the lies we were told, the car was not filled with gas. We took the car anyway and headed to San Diego. We woke up the next morning (New Years Day) and had planned to see a few sights before the car needed to be returned at our hotel in La Jolla. We went to the counter to confirm our time of return (which is suppose to be 30 minutes after the rental began in the first place). Well, the rep here tells us she is only open until noon and the car must be back by this time. There was absolutely NO notice of this at all and we were NEVER informed that Avis would be closing early. The rep was pretty rude and definitely showed she did not care much about our situation. After this, she went out to check the car. When she came back, she tried to charge our rental with gas money because the tank was 3/4 full (which was more full than the 1/2 tank we got when we picked up the car). She argued with me for about five minutes and I refused to pay any extra money, especially because we were returning at 9 am instead of the 4 pm we were expecting. Any way, we ended up taking a cab to what we had planned which was $100 total. I called Avis' costumer service number and they showed absolutely no interest in my complaint. I have rented from Hertz before and I know this would NEVER happen. Avoid Avis at all costs. They don't try harder.",

My sales rep. was sociable and professional and I was comfortable with the arranged payment plan. But what does that money get me?\n\nThe gym is less then a year old so the equipment and building are new and clean. With the appalling exception of the showers. There seems to always be at least two that are out-of-order, and the grime on them makes no sense what so ever for the time they have been in use.\n\nCondos have created an arms race in the form of amenities they offer their residences. With increased competition fitness centers have begun a similar war to draw clients. Below are the amenities the Markham LA fitness offers and does not offer.\n\nOffers\n\nBasket Ball court- Not a full court size and always packed\n\nSpin room - Lots of nice new bikes\n\nPersonal Training - I have only been bothered once about doing a fitness assessment \n\nPool - much like the basket ball court, it is available but more so just to say they have one. Its barely bigger then a waiting pool\n\nYoga/ fitness class - Have not attended myself but I see them going on regularly \n\njuice bar - over priced\n\nkids center - if I were a parent I would be appreciative \n\nDoes not offer\n\nSquash courts - squash is available at some LA fitness but only with a premium membership usually 5$ extra pre month\n\nolympic lifting platform, running track, towels\n\nIf they fire whoever is the maintenance manager and get the cleanliness of the washrooms up to par I would raise this review to a respectable 3 star. LA has some work to do over all if they want to compete with Goodlife and the YMCA.",

    "text": "Another lovely, cheap seafood meal. I got two mackerels grilled and six whitings fried. That was two separate platters. It came with two whole wheat pitas placed under the fish, three whole deep fried pitas, three sides of hummus, and four lemons sliced into halves. I also got 1lb of cold, roasted veggies (zucchini, assorted bell peppers, and eggplant). \n\nThe fish platters cost me just under $20 before tax and the veggies cost me $4 before tax. This was dinner for my parents and me, and we had a whole mackerel, two whiting, assorted pitas, hummus, lemons, and veggies left over. For a dinner that came to about $8/person before tax, that was a lot of food. \n\nIt was also done really well. The mackerel was super juicy and the whiting heads were crispy enough that I basically just ate the entire head without spitting out anything but the eyeballs. Yeah, I'm that kind of person. \n\nOh. I also got a mango juice from the drink section right across from the prepared food section. It was $0.99 and tasted like mangoes. I also got a basil seed drink that was quite pink. Rose flavored, supposedly. It tasted exactly the way Vitamin E Body Butter from the Body Shop smells, and has almost an aloe vera juice texture. I quite enjoyed it. It was also $0.99.\n\nFor dessert, I picked up a creme brulee for $3.49. My mom has a thing for creme brulee, but it is not cheap, so when I saw this one, I had to get it. It came in a ceramic dish the size of a CD. The ceramic dish was included in that price. The creme brulee custard was super creamy. It also was not too sweet. The sugar crust could have been crispier, but I understand that because it was not made fresh, it is hard to expect much more than what I got. This was a great deal though! I most certainly will get this again.\n\nAdonis is now one of my favorite places to get a seafood meal. Mmmmm.\n\nSide note: I've ordered seafood to be cooked three times now over the last two months or so, and one of the men at the seafood counter recognizes me. He still doesn't know my name, but we can work on that.",

I didn't eat there but the food didn't look too bad.\n \nThe inside was very clean, and they have multiple bars. 2 on the General Admission floors and one on the balcony. \n\nThe sound was nice, and there were great acoustics. The sightline were also very nice, and you could get a good view of the stage from pretty much anywhere in the venue. \n\nI sat up in the balcony and had a GREAT view of the stage. The bar was very close to my balcony seat and I had no problem getting a drink. They have a decent selection of beers.\n\nThe drinks, like any venue are over priced, I paid $7.25 for a tallboy of PBR.\n\nThe washrooms were also well maintained and were located downstairs. They had an attendant which I have NEVER seen. Don't really know why he's there.\n\nOpera House is a great Toronto venue that books some pretty great up and coming bands. It's not the easiest place to get to but not that hard either. \n\nI would definitely come back if they booked another band I wanted to see.",

    "text": "I've bee going here for 27 months to receive allergy shots on a weekly basis after my ENT recommended me here. They have multiple doctors who work at this location but I see Dr. Mark Schubert. I hardly ever meet with the doctor even though I am in the office once or twice a week to receive the injections administered by a nurse.\n\nThey seem to be helping with my symptoms but beware - at the beginning of this process I was told that I would receive an injection weekly for about a year. After about a year and a half I asked if there was anyway to speed up the process because it was inconvenient going every week and they said that they could split the allergens in to two separate  so that the dosage could be higher. I don't know why this wasn't offered to me as an option at the beginning of my treatment. So since January of this year I have been received two shots, one in each arm, every Tuesday and Friday. Recently, I questioned them about the process again and they said it takes about 3-5 years of weekly injections to build up a good immunity before you can go down to an injection every other week, etc. They said they have patients who have been receiving injections for 20 years!\n\nYou have to dedicate about an hour for this process too. When you get there you sign in, wait to have your name called, receive the injection, then have to wait a half hour at the office to make sure you don't have a bad reaction.\n\nI kind of feel like I'm getting scammed since they can bill insurance and/or get a co-pay for every office visit but I still have to get the injections since my allergies are so severe. Know what you're getting yourself in to if you start this regimen and commit to it.",

    "text": "Scottsdale, in Native American, translates to \"Land of fake boobs and day spas.\" You can find both at Hotel Valley Ho. But this review is only for the spa...\n\nIf you're looking for a expansive, over-the-top spa, complete with 4 dipping pools, 3 jacuzzis, 2 saunas, and an acre locker room, this isn't the place for you. But if you're looking for a low-key spa with friendly attendants, clean facilities, and a great deal then you should check this out this place.\n\nFacilties: a smallish locker room, 2 showers, 2 full-bathrooms with vanity area, a steamroom, and waiting room. With any treatment of 1 hour or more, you get full access to the fitness room. Complimentary shampoo, conditioner, facewash, lotions are available in the locker room, along with disposable brushes, combs, and razors. While you wait, enjoy some lemon water or Forte tea.\n\nServices: Massages, body treatments, and facials. I opted for the 90-minute Lomi Lomi which included a body scrub and massage.\n\nValue: Comparable to other spas in the Valley. However, they currently have a coupon on their website that gives you $25 off any 60- or 90-minute treatment. They also accept Spa Finder certificates ($100 certificates available at Costco for $80). Combine these things and you can enjoy the 90-minutes of heaven for $160, (20% tip included).\n\nValet parking available ($12 for overnight guests, free for visitors).",

Sat outside, enjoyed a beer (many choices) and a couple of salads. Service was prompt and attentive, the salmon salad was fresh, tasty and a generous portion.

We also ordered a custom sushi eel roll. The roll was 10 pieces and was very good. This place is a convenient alternative if you are in the mood for noodles. You may even want to take their sumo challenge of eating one of their giant noodle bowls.

    "text": "Took my crap car, Yelp's own Susan C. and her better half (who has a most impressive Montreal pedigree) out on a Sunday jaunt to the edges of Mississauga for what is generally reputed to be the best smoked meat to be had in Toronto. Well, the GTA.\n\nThe Montreal Deli is just west of the 427 and has plenty of parking. That I'm leading with it being conveniently located just beyond an overpass and raving about the parking might not bode well. But it's not that bad.\n\nSmoked meat in Toronto (or Mississauga) is what it is. Depending on your Clintonian definition of what \"is\" is, Montreal Deli is doing its best. Prices are reasonable. The super smoked meat plate (about $11.50) gives you a nice stack of meat, fully acceptable fries, slaw, and a kosher dill. If you think of this as anything *but* a simulacrum of the true Montreal smoked meat experience, well, it's pretty awesome all around.\n\nFor purists, I've included in the photo section a photo of the Montreal deli smoked meat super combo and the gold standard of smoked meat, Schwartz's. A keen observer will note the difference in consistency of the meat. The Montreal Deli serves it up almost like a thinly sliced ham. Schwartz's gives you thick rich slices of smoked meat ready to crumble and then melt in your mouth. [Oh god, 2.5 hours until lunch time. - your stomach butting in]\n\nSusan C's better half quibbled with the bread and I defer to his judgment there. I was a suburban boy (a shout out to my homies in Dollard-des-Ormeaux!) Susan's better half is a McGill grad, hence a veteran of smoked meat and it probably goes without saying the Peel pub. From his lack of joyous weeping, I gather he was in the same opinion boat as I.\n\nI'll say this, however, service is fast. I think we had our food in about five minutes. I've waited longer at McDonald's for a McFlurry. \n\nBottom line: prices are great, service is fast and great, you get a lot of great food, it's still not real Montreal smoked meat, but give it a try.\n\n(Those without access to a crap car, you can subway it to Kipling, I think jump on the West Mall bus, and then get off before it diverges off Dundas. It's not an unpleasant walk to the Montreal Deli.)",

I stopped in here at about 10:30 on a Friday night, which is right before Sip closes (they technically close at 11, but they stayed open a good 20-30 minutes past that when I was here), but everything was so awesome in that short amount of time that I'm gonna go ahead and give them five stars!\n\nI've been wanting to stop in here for awhile, and too be honest, I've mostly wanted to stop in the morning or afternoon for a coffee and/or food (and I'll be doing that at some point!), but the opportunity presented itself randomly on a Friday night so I stopped in for a couple beers.\n\nI loved the atmosphere. There's lots of space (both indoors & a patio), with comfortable chairs and couches. The staff is extremely friendly & outgoing. Since it was near the end of the night there were only a couple people working, but the guy working behind the bar (I believe his name was Alex...for as much as we talked to him I really should remember) was very outgoing. He seemed to know a lot about both the beers on tap & bottled beers & made my friend I was w/his own whiskey concoction, which she really liked. Speaking of whiskey, I was actually surprised this place even served liquor (I believe they only have whiskey). I just assumed they were beer & wine, but apparently they're not. \n\nLike I said, I really need to try some other things here to get more of a feel for this place, but I really liked what I saw & tasted in the short amount of time I stopped in for. \n\nOne last thing I should point out that I really like about this place is the hours. I actually LIKE that they close early (compared to bars). They attract a different crowd because of it, and if you're only looking to have a couple drinks it's a good place to start the night or just catch up with friends for a bit.",

I also really like Theresa's Bakery, Ohio City Pasta, and several of the meat vendors, one of whom makes a great variety of different sausages.\n\nThere's always a great atmosphere at West Side Market, too.

When I'm there, the place is abuzz with activity.\n\nAll in all, West Side Market is just a great place.

We got right to the front and went on immediately. It took about 35 minutes to go around once which is plenty of time to view the strip and catch a buzz. Inside was a small bar with a bartender making drinks quickly. All you can drink means my group was drinking fast! The drinks were kind of weak but we kept sucking them down trying to get our money's worth of drinks. Good music inside, benches to sit, awesome views, what more do you need?!",

    "text": "I did buy a car here because I wanted it and because I do try to use my most local dealership when I can, but I cannot say I loved the experience.   \n\nOverall, the problem was with the process.  I liked my salesperson.  Everyone was friendly enough and I have at least some hopes for the service department; however, for a luxury car dealership, the process lacked luxury for sure.  \n\nI went on a whim on a Saturday and test drove one vehicle.  That went fine and was reasonably efficient.  I then wanted to see a more upgraded model before deciding.  That took over an hour, since as a city dealership, they have to go get the car.  The car ran out of gas on the way, so there was that delay as well.  I looked and left, asking the salesperson to provide pricing via e-mail because I was out of time by the time they got the car there.   \n\nThere were some wires crossed in the communication, but we eventually all got on the same page and I made an appointment at 9am the following Saturday to show them my trade and complete a cash purchase.  I had already shown my tendency toward impatience on the previous visit.  And I very clearly stated that I didn't want to be there all morning when I made the appointment, so I was hoping that they'd have everything ready except for my trade value.  Not so much.  \n\nThe trade evaluation was quick, but then the inefficiency really started.  They didn't have the pricing ready, so there was a wait there.  Then the finance guy was needed (no loan, but he also does title work and the warranty sales spiel ).  He had not a thing prepared either, so I had to wait for him.  Then to the cashier, who had to call and verify my check and issue a receipt - more waiting.  The tech guy who explained all the buttons was next - had to wait for him too.  His spiel needed a little work, but it was good enough.  Then the car needed gassed - again, another wait. \n\nAll told, an efficient process could have easily taken under an hour.  This took over two and a half and that was with me quite impatiently skipping pieces and trying to push it along.  The problem is that their whole process is linear - you are passed from one person to the next with a lot of waiting in between.  Why they can't gas up the car while I am doing the paperwork is beyond me.  Why the tech guy couldn't have done his thing in the 45 minutes I spent waiting for the finance guy is also beyond me.  Why the cashier couldn't have worked on my check while I was doing title work...you get the idea.   \n\nI am sure that people generally spend a ton more time buying a car and perhaps that is normal, but I made an appointment specifically to avoid all of that.  If they are truly serving the luxury market, they need to coordinate the buying process better.",

By the end of that day she was eating again and the following day her energy level was waaaay up.

    "text": "I don't trust them. At first, they seemed great. Then they required me to pay up front for a night guard I needed. It was odd to me that I needed to pay up front, but they wouldn't give it to me without payment. So, I paid. I have two insurances--one did not pay, but the other paid quite a bit. I was told that if insurance covered, they'd put a check in the mail right away. Those were their words. I've seen nothing. I've yet to go in to try to get my money. I'll update when I do. \n\nThe next issue was that my daughter supposedly needed four crowns. She'd been at a pediatric dentist. But she is 17 and he noticed she had one problem area that look like a possible crown and her pediatric dentist felt she was ready to go to a regular dentist. He said her teeth looked great except for that one spot. So, we go to Providence Dental where they tell us she needs at least four crowns and possibly root canals. I tell the dentist that her pediatric dentist didn't say she needed all of that. His response? \"That's why you need to take kids to a real dentist. I wouldn't take my own kids to a pediatric dentist past the age of seven.\" So--a pediatric dentist isn't a real dentist? \n\nWhen we walked in for one of my daughter's appointments, the gal at the front desk tells me my amount after insurance. It was really high. I was confused but almost paid it, but then I stopped and said, \"Is that with both of our insurances?\" She says, \"Yes, but since you're getting x type (can't remember what it is called) of crowns, your insurance won't cover it.\" So, I asked what type of crowns those are. She explains they're a special kind of crown but covered by a warranty, blah blah blah. I tell her no one mentioned those to me before this. Are they mandatory? She says, no they're optional. So, they were trying to upsell me these special crowns without even telling me anything about them before hand. She tells me that they're really great and under warranty so if anything happens they can be fixed or replaced. I tell her I had a crown that fell out once and my insurance fixed it--so why would I pay for an expensive crown that insurance won't cover if I can pay for a normal crown that insurance will cover. She just looked at me. She had no answer. It was ridiculous. \n\nAfter that visit, I decided we weren't going back. I started hunting for a new dentist. My husband still planned to continue going to Providence Dental. He had an appointment in December but had to reschedule due to his crazy work schedule. So, he switched it to February. In February, he had to reschedule again. This time he told the lady he just wanted to cancel and would reschedule when things calmed down at work. She was extremely rude to him. She kept pressing him to just reschedule and if he couldn't make it, he could reschedule again. He insisted that he had no idea when to make the appointment because of work and would just feel better making the appointment when he had a better idea of an opening in his schedule. She kept sighing heavily and being snippy with him. So, he's decided he's done there too. \n\nTwo of my kids are still at their pediatric dentist. We've been with that dentist for over a decade. We've never had an issue with the staff, with the dentist or with billing. I wish we could all just see that dentist. Finding a good dentist who isn't just out for the money is really difficult.",

Ordered medium rare, it came out well done. I told the waitress who looked at it and said let me check. She came back and said that the kitchen would make me another quickly. Ok fine, though the rest of my party was almost finished eating their meals. By the time she brought out my new rack, I could already tell something was wrong. I cut into it and not surprised, it was completely raw. When the waitress came back to check on me I showed her the raw meat and she seemed confused and said that yes, I had ordered medium rare. Um, no. The manager came over and offered to have the chef cook it again. By that time everyone was done with their meals so I declined and said I didn't want it anymore. We got 'free' dessert but was annoyed that the manager didn't do more to make it right. No voucher nor discount off our $521 bill. Very disappointed and will not be back again. I guess one good thing was that I was the only one who ordered from the grill tonight.   What a disaster it would have been if we all ordered steaks!  We also ordered a dozen oysters from the raw bar which took over 30 mins to come. We thought they forgot when the waitress started serving our other appetizers without a mention of where the oysters were until we asked when she came back to collect the plates to which she nonchalantly explained that the bar was very busy.  Really? For a dozen oysters? Will not be back again.",

    "text": "I have eaten here multiple times and this may be one of my new favorite restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh! The first time we sat at the pizza bar which is a Great place to sit and watch your pizza being made in the wood fire oven! A show must have let out shortly after we arrived because there was a rush of people at the door suddenly and they were telling people it'd be a 45 minute wait! We split the carnivore pizza which was absolutely delicious! Bacon, pepperoni, and sausage- the dough was delicious as well!They have a great craft beer selection, the wine prices seemed to high to me, but everything else seemed priced appropriately. I'd also recommend the Bianca pizza or the Forrest if you are looking for a veggie pizza. I've also eaten here for lunch, which was not as satisfying so the \"star ratings\" are really based on my dinner experiences. I ordered the chicken caprese puccia(balsamic-marinated chicken breast / house-cured black pepper bacon / oven-roasted Roma tomato / house-made basil pesto / house mozzarella) The bread completely overwhelmed the sandwich and when I opened it up to see how big the piece of chicken was it was literally half the size of my palm! I'm a very small person so obviously if it's half the size of my palm I don't even think this constitutes as acceptable on a sandwich. The flavors were good but it was disappointing because of the proportion of bread to meat. I will say,however, that the homemade chips were AMAZING and probably honestly the best I have ever had-and I am NOT a chip person at all! My boyfriend had the soup special (chilled pepper with scallops) and the special for lunch (pork and spaetzle with pancetta). he too commented on the size of his entree which looked more like an appetizer but it was tasty. The soup (besides the chips which again were amazing but that's not a reason to return anywhere) was I think the highlight for both of us. I'll still return but I think for dinner instead of lunch",

    "text": "Price is right, but food quality is blahhhhhh.  I succumbed to the TV advertising and went to try again.  I was disappointed.  I got a large 3 topping hand tossed pizza.  Crust was crappy, sauce was crappy, and toppings were OK but sparse.  I would rather pay a higher price and get a better pizza.  I also got  16 piece box of boneless chicken too.  That was pretty horrible -- just dry pieces of breast meat breaded and fried.  Very dry and even though the breading was seasoned, it still was crummy tasting.  I think it would have been better with batter instead of breading.  Oh well, you get what you pay for.  These days, all pizza is not worth the money.  For approximately the same price, you can get a full meal at other restaurants.  The only saving grace to pizza is that it is finger and convenience food. But that is about it.",

As always we were running late and in a rush, this led my boyfriend to dropping our box of beautiful cupcakes which quickly got destroyed. After trying to \"put them back together\" we decided that the box was too messy to take the cupcakes in and went back into the store to ask for a different box. The look on his face must have been desperate since the girls not only gave him a new box but gave him new cupcakes all together. We are firm believers of supporting mom & pops shops but with this kind of service it not only makes it easier but a pleasure.\n\nThanks again!",

Since we were the only customers on a Sunday evening, I would hazard a guess that the menu changes are an attempt to attract a wider customer base.  We began with a delicious beet salad that included both cabbage and seasoned carrots followed shortly by varenki, Russian style dumplings generously filled with melt-in-your mouth potatoes and sour cream.  For an entree my wife ordered schnitzel, an Israeli style chicken fillet that had been rolled in panko and fried, adding a small house salad at a nominal cost. I chose beef stroganoff served in a cream and mushroom sauce.  Both entrees included a good sized portion of roasted young potatoes that were delicious.  Unfortunately the entrees were less successfully with the beef being a little too tough and the chicken on the dry side.",

Now I've def had a couple times were the food was not so great but remember its not the server most times its the cooks fault. They are good at having food runners and to run the food asap. So the majority of the time when it takes forever for your food its because of the cooks.

Let me say this, what a super fun show!  I was laughing so damn hard.  I will say that Frank Marino is really engaging and hilarious.  Just a side note, he talks in rapid fire, stand-up style and throws a lot of show biz references and jokes that some generations/foreigners may not get.  So brush up on your current events and pop stars!  \n\nThere are a lot of drag performers performing as stars like: Beyonce, Madonna, Shania Twain, Mariah, Janet Jackson...Cher was prob my personal fav, but all the acts were great.  It is nice that you can sing along and that the audience is so carefree and chill.  There were people of all ages there and the place is so small that you really don't get a bad seat.  I recommend the middle though and not the left and right sides. My upgrade tickets were $20 and drinks were under $10, so this is totally affordable for a show on the strip.\n\nThe kinda naked male dancers did the majority of the dancing.  There was one guy who was 2-3 beats off from the rest, but after a while you got used to his dancing being off. lol.  Oh and the end gets you too.

We arrived just after 8am on Saturday morning of Fourth of July weekend, and we were pleasantly surprised to get a room right away.  However, the staff wasn't particularly friendly.  Not rude, but just not friendly.  We had breakfast at Mr. Lucky's, then hit the pool.  We went to the Rehab pool first, where we would've had to purchase $100 in food and drinks each to use a lounge chair.  So we wandered to the \"family pool\" where we could occupy lounge chairs without a food/drink minimum.  It was frustrating that they don't allow any outside food or drinks, not even water or gum!  So when we went to the bar to get a beer we would get a cup of ice too, and either let it melt down or fill it at the water fountain near the bathrooms.  Since we weren't staying Sunday night, we weren't given free admission to Rehab on Sunday, which was fine because we didn't really think that would be our scene anyway. \n\nI'll miss their beds next time I'm in Vegas, but I probably won't stay here again.",

I will say that we are not huge fans of the lo mein here, but that is true of all the Chinese restaurants we have tried locally, so it really isn't that big a deal.  \n\nThe cashier is the same gentleman each time and each time he is unfailingly nice and smiling.  \n\nOther bonus features: the place is clean, the parking lot is easy to find a spot in, most people are taking to-go orders, so if you want to dine in it's actually pretty quiet, and it's next door to a Starbucks if you want somewhere to relax after in the now cooler air!\n\nOverall: A\nWe highly recommend the pot stickers and fried rice with any of the meat additions (chicken, pork, beef, etc.)",

For vegetarians, the Volcano tofu is awesome! I also love a chicken dish with onions in a dark garlic sauce, but don't remember the name of the dish. The chicken meat used in the dishes is moist, tender, and non-fatty. I have been to many restaurants in China, and I like Segal's Chinese food better! :o) The prices are excellent considering the meat is kosher. Great restaurant for non-Jews to try as well; the food tastes better than other non-kosher Chinese restaurants in phoenix.",

    "text": "Trust me when they say Kia will show you the power to surprise you with dynamic HIDDEN FEEs and HORRIFYING experiences that go beyond your expectations. Oh they will surprise you alright... Read my story below. \nSo I got a new car from this dealership Kia Optima S 2018 (224/227) test driven miles on April 7, 2018. We negotiated a price of approximately 23k for the vehicle and I was very firm on my monthly payments and what I expected to pay the sales person Ian he didn't tell me that it wasn't a firm final offer. So I sign everything and get everything settled and stuff I get called on (04/12/2018) being told the bank won't approve for the length of my term but that I got a lower interest rate and better offer. So this is from TJ finance manager, I get in and guess what? Not the finance manager nor the sales person who sold me the car would speak to me, Chris a person I've never met, tries to negotiate with me and tells me the price is gonna be well over $400 a month I told them this isn't what I negotiated and looking at the total price for 72 months the car comes out to over 30k... that's almost 10k more, how are they going to charge me that much? They didn't even bother explaining anything to me, so I said no, what are my options? he didn't give me any, so I said I had no problem returning the car and going to Honda. Chris says honda won't get me a good deal and they are the worst and I said the worst that can happen is being lied to and you guys did that. So I did what any reasonable person would do... I took my stuff from the car and gave them the keys, and left to Honda. So today, I go and ask for my downpayment check which isn't cut, and Chris had told me he would have it cut, and he says the finance team wasn't there supposedly and they can't cut my check, they want to mail it and I clearly say NO, I need my money. He said Monday the earliest. This the 4th lie from Kia. So now they are giving me the run around. Seriously, stay away from this dealership. Check out the reviews from BBB and online these aren't lies. They are scammers and try to add hidden fees. So if it's possible look elsewhere. Returning the vehicle was the best decision I made in my life. Go to Honda or any dealership, they have Kia's there. If anyone is doubting this I kept copies of everything and I do hope this review helps others to realize that the car they have they can return if you're bullied into a deal you know that you can't afford, you have time to return it, read the fine detail it's there. Please be aware and know it's possible. Take YOUR hard earned money and time elsewhere where they will value you, clearly Kia doesn't. I will be filing a complaint with BBB and the company and leaving reviews on all social platforms. Thanks Kia for allowing me to have the best experience over at Honda 1333 E Camelback Rd and making me realize that Kia isn't worth the time.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to try out the Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill since we are local fans of his.  We were very pleased with Burgr at the Planet Hollywood and figured we would be equally pleased here.  Overall we really wanted to like the place but were disappointed and will not return, especially after the surreal experience towards the end of our stay.\n\nWe didn't have to wait to long to get in (30 minutes and my wife won some decent coin on the slots beforehand).  Our server was not very knowledgeable about the beer selection or other items on the menu (as we were about to find out).  My wife wanted to get a beer comparable to Stella Artois (something we could justify spending $10 on) but the server could not help us identify a similar beer since we were unfamiliar with some of the brands and figured he was.  We ended up ordering sodas and water instead.  Probably a wise choice considering the cost.\n\nI ordered the bangers and mash and my wife ordered the onion soup and the mac and cheese.  I enjoyed the sausage links (made in-house) but felt the potatoes were a bit overdone with cream and butter.  My wife liked the onion soup but felt that there was only one tiny slice of french bread on the top and not the normal amount of bread usually served with this soup.  The taste of the mac and cheese was pretty good yet the noodles were very underdone.  They were about 3-4 minutes away from being al dente.  When my wife brought this up to our server (she has professional kitchen and culinary training), he said \"yes, the noodles are supposed to be al dente\", and that was it.  It was a weird exchange.  It was too bad the noodles were too gummy because the rest of it was pretty tasty.\n\nI had never had rhubarb before, so my wife ordered the rhubarb cobbler from the menu.  After about 15 minutes, our server came to us and said the item had been 86'd from the menu but they were making some more \"downstairs\".  My wife (a former employee of Caesars/Harrahs) asked about the other desserts and found that they come from the downstairs bakery that provides pastries for other eateries in the casino.  We were very disappointed with this news.  The desserts might be Ramsay's recipes or they might not be (it wasn't clear to us), but the fact that they were being mass-produced in the downstairs bakery rather than in-house upset us a little.  Nothing against the people who work in the bakery at Caesar's (they make some delicious pastry), but for a fine dining experience you would expect to get your dessert made in house at the prices being charged.  After 15 more minutes they delivered the cobbler, yet the cobbler they delivered was a peach cobbler.  She again notified our server, and this is where it got bizarre.  He argued that it was indeed rhubarb (a different kind of rhubarb at that) mixed with other fruits.  My wife was flabbergasted, as was I.  She knows the difference between a rhubarb and a peach and was offended that our server tried to convince us otherwise.  I have no experience with rhubarb myself, yet I know it is reddish-purple because I see it at the store.  I also know what a peach looks like, and it looked and tasted exactly like the fruit that was in the cobbler.  There wasn't a shred of red or purple anywhere in that cobbler, just straight up yellow.  After we left, I looked up a picture of rhubarb cobbler and it was bright red and purple.  We sent the cobbler back and they did not charge us for it.  Afterwards the manager came to us and apologized for the mix-up, yet still carried the viewpoint that it was a different kind of rhubarb.  I mean, enough already.  It was peach.  End of story.  \n\nLong story short we wanted to like the place, but were disappointed and slightly offended that they kind of thought we were dum-dums in the great rhubarb/peach debate.  Good thing Gordon Ramsay has a good burger place in town to fall back on.",

    "text": "I\"m not sure if Roy A. was referring to the Bloor Park GoodLife club or this Manulife Centre club (they are only a couple of blocks from each other) but unless they changed the rules, this club does not have mandatory towel service but the other one does.  This is one of the older GoodLife clubs but it was renovated several years ago (I can't remember the exact time frame as I was a member of Bally Fitness back then) but I want to say 2004-2005.\n\nThe club is located on the second level offices opposite the theatres and the layout is a bit odd as it seems like everything was shoe horned to fit some leftover space.  This location has a swimming pool though many may challenge that definition and call it an oversized bathtub.  It is unique for any gym in the downtown to offer a pool and it uses salt water.\n\nThe facility is small and there is minimal equipment so expect to share often working in while you're resting between sets.  You need to pass through an open concept spinning room to get to a weights area and the aerobics room in the far back of the gym.  The older gym had old carpeting and the update has certainly helped.  I use this club when i'm in the area so it's my second most used gym outside of my home club.\n\nThe trainers and members seem pretty nice here bit I'm not familiar with any of the instructors in these classes.  Despite it's small size, it has enough equipment to get a short workout in without any major issues.The space is tight between the equipment and some of them are older.  Will not accommodate many members and has shorter hours than most other GoodLife clubs.  Overall, I'll rate it as a 3 star facility.",

After a long boycott of this establishment by myself because of how they handled their grand opening food giveaway, I finally decided, WTH let's give them a shot. Unfortunately, I should have held tight with the boycott. I walk in at lunchtime and there is just one table with any patrons at it, and they were served right after I ordered, so I figured my wait shouldn't be long. Wrong... apparently it's takes way more time than I realized to cook a burger that is the size of a quarter. And even though they are tiny little pucks of meat, they are priced like a regular sized burger. And none of that would have drawn my ire had they simply made my one teeny, tiny burger as I had ask them to, which they did not. Not even close. And when I called to let them know how they goofed, I didn't receive an apology, but rather was told to come back for the correct burger. Yeah, I'll pass on that. But if you enjoy paying more for itty bitty portions and subpar customer service, this is the place for you.",

    "text": "Once upon a time, I would bring everyone I knew to this restaruant for a fun-time and good brunch. Now, I never suggest it and refuse to step foot in again. \n\nThe atmosphere is sort of fun-loving with a cute minibar at the front of the restaurant and seating arrangements spanning from patio, main floor and second floor. \n\nThe service is almost non-existant...You have a server appear once and then never again. You are perched or famished or something but no one is in sight...You can hear staff laughter or see them sipping on a beverage while you try to control your own thirst for water or coffee or tea. If you have a table to wait on, why are you not doing so? Of course, I am not suggesting to constantly be on the lookout for what to do for your customers but some semblance of thoughtfulness of bringing over the menu or a glass of water really goes a long way!\n\nThe food is inedible. My go to was always the Blueberry Hill. However...Once it was slightly burned which I excused and simply ate. The second time was completely burned. Each pancake was covered in burnt pieces of dough...There was an attempt to conceal it with more blueberry compote but failed miserably. I had asked to replace it and was denied. This ties back to the notion that customers are not the priority here but rather maintaining a relaxed attitude is. Again all we diners ask is that our food is cooked well (or even decently or maybe even considered edible) because we pay for your services and your food. You hurt your customer's trust in your product by displaying certain things and frankly, this is not my recommended anything anymore.",

    "text": "So, as much as I like to think of myself as pretty put together, try to be hip and cool, but when it comes to make up, I am a real make up virgin. Okay, perhaps not a virgin per say, but a novice, a newbie, perhaps a beginner wanting to migrate to intermediate. Primers, different brushes for different areas, strobe, pinch pots, bb creme vs foundation, wth? \nI'm pretty simple with the whole make up game, but do occasionally fantasize that I could put on make up and not look a french prostitute, and even though the talented make up artists at Mac know a thing or two about beautifying oneself through make up application, I often don't love the finished look of my painted up face. I must say though this last time, Christina was very skilled in the whole make up process. \nHaving brought a friend in who is newly divorced and even less adept in make up than myself, I was so excited to see her all gussied up, fake lashes and all. \nI purchased a few items, will try them out, and as they say, practice makes perfect. \nMac is a little pricey, but I do think some of their products are worth it. I have read they don't test on animals anymore, which is a good thing, I try to only buy products from companies that don't. Testing on furry friends is not cool. \nHave been to this location a few times, would return again when I need more.",

We ordered a serving of 4 of the vegetable egg rolls, and for the main course we opted for the crispy honey chicken with a side of brown rice.  The waitress arrived with 2 egg rolls but we told her not to bother to go back to the kitchen for the remaining order.  Glad we did because the egg rolls tasted stale as though they sat around for a week and were reheated for serving.  The dipping sauce was a spicy chili sauce and it was terrific, especially in offsetting the stale flavor of the egg rolls.  The main course of honey chicken itself was tender and had no grizzle.  However the dish lacked any flavor whatsoever.  There was a sparing amount of glaze on the plate which accompanied the chicken but it too didn't add much taste to the dish.  I wouldn't order the egg rolls and the honey chicken again.  The big surprise was the brown rice.  It was awesome.  It was tender and cooked to perfection.  Last but not least: I found their dinner napkins to have an odd and offensive smell as though they sat around in some grimy old closet for years.   It'll be a while before we go back if ever.",

    "text": "10/29/11 DINNER.\n\nMixed emotions on this one. Came hoping to love, left a little disappointed.\n\nME: Linguine w/ triple cream brie w/ toasted walnuts, mushrooms, prosciutto, fresh herbs & Parmesan. Added chicken for $3 more, per waiter's suggestion. There was brie, even some chunks, but it wasn't very strong, in aroma or flavor. (When I drank a sip of Point Noir with a bite, that seemed to bring out the brie.) There were absolutely no mushrooms, which were greatly missed in this dish. And there was hardly any prosciutto, again, missed. Basically I ended up with walnuts & chicken in linguine in a creamy cheese sauce. And I didn't need the chicken after all, I think the dish would've been better without it. Overall, an OK dish, but not as interesting since it didn't follow the menu description. (FOLLOWUP: I had some left over the next day, and it actually improved in brie flavor having set overnight in the fridge.)\n\nSPOUSE: Filet Oscar, which was  the classic filet of beef topped w/ king crab and Bearnaise sauce, w/ asparagus, then drizzled w/ Cabernet sauce, all on top of leek mashed potatoes. OK, there was a POOL of Cabernet sauce, and hardly any Bearnaise. The beef was good, for a filet, and exactly as ordered, rare. But for the money spent, spouse wasn't thrilled. Good, not great. His meal did come with choice of a salad or soup, he chose butternut squash soup, which was good, tasted more like pumpkin, earthy & sweet.\n\nDESSERT: We split the pear dessert, which was again good, not great. We also split a glass of Chilean dessert sauvignon blanc, which the waiter brought in separate glasses, a nice touch. The wine was recommendable: fruity, aromatic, not too sweet.\n\nWINES: All we drank were wines-by-the-glass. It was nice to find a Patricia Green Pinot Noir on a by-the-glass list. The cheaper-line-by-Schraumsberg Mirabelle sparkling rose was better than I had expected. (LONG time ago, I had tried Mirabelle Brut and thought it smelled/tasted like bug spray! Obviously Schramsberg has improved the wines on their secondary program!) And the nebbiolo was fine. But the bill for 4 glasses of wine skyrocketed the cost of our experience.\n\nSERVICE/VENUE: Attentive, nice waiter. Nice setting. (We had to sit outside, cuz it was crazy full inside, but the heater sufficed for the outdoors at night.)\n\nOVERALL: If we had not had our $50 Groupon with us, we would've paid $170+ for this meal, which I found rather crazy. I'm glad I finally tried Grape Street, but I won't go outta my way to return.\n\nPS: I wish we could have tried the food at Nora's Wine Bar, which closed recently. The only day we visited, we only got to do wines. THAT menu looked incredible, authentic Italy Italian, AND they had a fantastic selection of wines by the glass as well. Sigh.",

    "text": "Good, but not great...\n\nSloppiness in the kitchen prevented this from being a better review than it is, but if the kitchen can make mistakes like these, I have serious questions about how good they are.\n\nWe all had salads for our first course:\n - The Caesar was enough for two, but the dressing was boring to say the least.  No brightness of any sort.\n - The baby beets were good, though again the dressing was much understated - that is to say, mostly olive oil.\n - The arugula was fine, but again nothing special.\n - The roasted red peppers were fine, though oily.\n\nAs for mains:\n - The New York strip was cooked perfectly, but was served a little above room temperature.  I would have sent it back, but figured that if I did so, I'd be getting my steak while everyone else was having dessert.\n - The filet we had at the table was excellent.  However, the portion was huge.\n - The flat iron steak was a bit small and not cooked medium well as requested, but the taste was excellent.\n - The grilled salmon was cooked properly and was deemed to be wonderful.\n\nSides:\n - Asparagus - grilled to death and greasy  - uck!\n - Brussels Sprouts - what can you say about food cooked with bacon - yummy - if not a bit greasy.  (We ate all of them.)\n - Potatoes - we ordered Fingerlings but got whipped Yukon Gold.  (We didn't request a change since it was not worth worrying about.)  The whipped potatoes had enough butter and cream in them to clog the arteries of the people at the table next to ours.  Consistency was a bit too much like baby food for us, but they were very good.\n\nDesserts:\n - Ice cream - not much to say about that\n - Monkey bread - very good, but very rich\n - Banana brioche bread pudding - okay - I'm still waiting for the taste of the banana.\n\nFor the price of the meal, the portions were very generous.  All of the sides were big enough for generous helpings for two or three people.  However, the fact that the kitchen sent out a cold steak and grossly overcooked asparagus gives me more than ample cause for concern.\n\nAll of the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.\n\nAll-in-all, a very good value for the money, but the kitchen needs to clean up their act.  I would give them a second chance, but having been to other steak houses in Vegas, it would be a hard sell, since we know of better choices with more professional kitchens and exceptional service.",

    "text": "My airline is a corporate sponsor, so I get 2 for 1 tickets.  Yay!  I like this venue, but I don't love it.  This was my third time here.  I was exhausted by about Floor 3.  There are some cool displays and some interesting information, but I don't think I would have been too thrilled to have paid full price.  The best part is the Induction section.  Huge screens with videos highlighting inductions over the years.  It is long.  But you get to sit down.  After walking around the museum for about three hours, it felt good to do so.  Parking is $8 in the lot to the east of the museum, close to the lake.  It was the cheapest lot we found.  The thing that bothers me about this museum is the music competing with other music.  For example, the Beatles section is close to the Rolling Stones section, but you can't really appreciate the background music playing for either one, since you hear pieces of \"Love Me Do\" when you are trying to appreciate \"Satisfaction\".  The costumes on display are another great section of the museum.  I loved that part.  It gets a little crowded on the weekends, so try to go during the week if you can.  I will probably return again if I have friends from out of town visiting, but I am happy I don't have to pay full price.",

Luckily there were spots available both in parking (big plaza with tons of food shops) and inside. Ordered a mango bingsu and chocolate waterfall (ice cream & toast), which were 11.99 each. Interesting that I asked the staff for recommendations but they just directed me towards the menu....haha\n\nThe bingsu was definitely my favourite among the two. The mango was diced into small pieces that made it easy to enjoy with the shaved ice. Did not have as much of the chocolate waterfall, but the toast was nice and crunchy. The menu is a bit small but they have all the common bingsu options (e.g. matcha, mango, strawberry, five cereal) and similar flavors for their \"waterfall\". Definitely stacks up among all the other dessert shops in that plaza and nearby!",

    "text": "So this is the Campus \"Club\" for faculty and staff where you must purchase a membership to dine here or pay extra. Been here a few times for work lunches and thought the food was mediocre at best.\n\nMy latest experience here was on Tuesday for the Holiday Buffet which cost roughly $30/person for lunch and the best dish they had there was cocktail shrimp (I believe that says a lot regarding the quality of this establishment). There was a salad bar with not only salad but quinoa (pretty good) and veggies. They also offered salmon which was cold, tasteless, dry, as well as pork, steak, turkey which happen to all be tasteless and chewy. Dessert bar was cookies that looked like they were from Costco (which might be better since they're chewy), some tarts and a holiday dessert. \n\nThey opened the window to the room which held all the food and it was pretty chilly on Tuesday so obviously there will be a draft which will cause the food to be cold even if you place it under a heat lamp/warming tray - go figure.\n\nService here is meh. It's like the judge you whether or not you have an actual membership or a guest pass (which we had). I enjoy the dinning rooms as they are very Victorian-esque atmosphere. Overall, I could not justify spending $53 on a lunch buffet and a glass of cab-sav wine.. I could have gotten an actual good meal elsewhere on campus like poutine and for a fraction of that price.",

Unfortunately, I didn't think the green apple pur??e was a good match with the scallops.l, it was too sour. 3 points goes to the scallops though!\n\nMAINS:\nDUCK CONFIT (4/5)\n(With wild mushroom risotto)\nMm the duck confit was delish! The skin was very crispy with just the right amount of fatty and duck meat. The mushroom risotto was also great - it gets salty after a while but still a great mix with the duck leg. \n\nPAN SEARED CHILEAN SEA BASS (4/5)\n(Saffron infused rice, caper meuniere sauce, diced tomato)\nFor those who would like something more healthy tasting, this is a good choice. A very light dish - the sea bass was tasty and fresh. I enjoyed this dish very much. \n\nDESSERT: \nTOFFEE CAKE (5/5) \nYou would be missing out if you didn't save room for this dessert!! I looooved this toffee cake. So good - there was a crunchy glazed toffee on top of the vanilla ice cream and the toffee cake is at the bottom. I would come back again just to order this dessert.

Great satisfying meal. As I have read comments regarding portion sizes, I must disagree. It's curry. You do not want to over due it. I feel they give you good size portions. Everything is made to order so the food comes piping hot. My sauce has always been the right thickness. My only issue is I think the roti bread should come with the meals and not be added on.

Yeah, I've fallen for this place just like many others have. Even though part of my heart still belongs to my first (taco) love, Los Parados. But, that place is long gone and I'm just glad I finally have El Gordo to fill the void.\n\nThe adobada tacos ($2 ea.) are every bit as good as everyone says they are. The best part of the pork were the pieces carved from the exterior of the pork on a spit. They had an amazing crispy, charred edge to it that added to the transcendent flavor and texture combinations of the tacos.\n\nAnd, don't forget about the carne asada tacos ($2 ea.). They're some of the best I've had in town. The quality of the beef was outstanding. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the slimy green faux-guac sauce covering the meat. Next time I'll just have to get the tacos plain, with nothing but onions and cilantro.\n\nEveryone seems to love this place, as evidenced by the long lines that snaked through the restaurant during the peak lunch time. So, whether or not you love tacos or are a taco virgin, stop by Tacos El Gordo and you'll be enthralled too.",

    "text": "I am in love with this concept! What I'm even more enamored with is the 3 min walk it takes me to get here... holla holla! \n\nI went for the Grand Opening last night and was super excited to try all of these unique restaurants with inspiring flair on the standard dishes we know and love.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Rice Shop (essentially like a Poke place - but they did have a delicious looking chicken bowl with broccoli and rice. That's the one I'd grab since I'm not huge on the raw fish movement lol)\n\nTin Man (I think the vibe here is like... an All American experience. They have a DELICIOUS burger, onion straws, chicken and dumplings, pot roast, apple inspired dishes and desserts) \n\nSauce The City (to DIE for crispy deep fried chicken with a bounty of flavorful sauces - Homestyle, Cleveland Hot and Sauce Fire Hot - which I can only imagine how intense that one is as I smelled the heat coming off a plate that passed by me. They have a fun spin on fire roasted corn on the cob and of COURSE, Sweet Tea!)\n\nPOCA (a very authentic Mexican restaurant. This isn't like your standard places. This is a straight from Mexico (classy establishment) type of Mexican (Oaxacan inspired to be specific) with chicken thighs and mole sauce and tamales. This isn't your \"grab a taco\" kind of Mexican. They have guacamole with a nice citrus flavor and robust jalape??o kick which they serve with a side of mole sauce - this stuff has some heat behind it, ayiyi!)\n\nNow let's talk about the bar! And the seating! Omg you guys, we have too much to cover. Am I going to be flagged for saying too much? Will I run out of characters? The world may never know!!!\n\nSo once you pop in the doors of the place you can go left to the restaurants or right to the bar... \"right to the bar\" is usually my motto... tehehe. Never fear if you've steered to the left first... this place works in a circle and you can always find your way through the back end of the bar. The open floor and beautiful lights were amazing! Who doesn't want to eat in this kind of environment? The bar was very modern and offered up all kinds of ritzy true mixologist created cocktails with ingredients I had to google, of course. That's a mark of a real trendy place, I tell ya! They have a nice list of fun draft beers too!\n\nThe seating is spread all around the place and you can either sit at a larger communal table with others or a smaller table for intimacy. You set your number down from your restaurant of choice and some impressive treasure hunt wizards roam the floor to find you. Truly a difficult task, if you ask me. Kudos! I wonder if the training was successfully finding Waldo in a series of photos LOL - especially food courts. \n\nAll in all I really enjoyed OCG! From a pocket book standpoint, it's not a place you hit up daily. It's pretty expensive, namely the bar, but if you're in the mood for some legitimately homemade cuisines and hand crafted cocktails with a more casual vibe... this is your place!!!",

Self serve drink station (EVEN WATER!), plastic drink ware, cheapened food, missing high-end options - no hot tea, no beef Wellington, no banana foster, no king crab legs, etc. How does MGM have the audacity to charge \"Gourmet Dinner\" for the Fourth of July at almost $100 per couple, to serve junk. Well you fooled me once, you will not again. Today, we celebrated our Sunday Brunch at Wicked Spoon and loved it, less expensive and far superior in every aspect.\n\nDo not waste your money at Bellagio, simply go to Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal for the same price or less. \n\nThis is coming from an MGM GOLD PLAYER",

    "text": "This is an update to my previous review on 9/16/2013.  I've now bumped up the rating from a 1 to a 4 for my overall experience.  Lauren L., Customer Advocate Manager, was great.  She promptly followed up with me to discuss my issues I was experiencing.  She was very friendly and genuinely sounded like she was concerned.  Also, my Loan Officer, Erik E, reached out to me to make sure everything was processed timely and followed through to closing.  Everything finally closed a few days late but none the less, closed and finalized.\n\nI originally selected  RoundPoint based on feeling the most comfortable with my Loan Officer after a few initials contacts through phone and email.  They weren't the lowest rates but one of the lowest plus very responsive.  One thing I would say is be aware of and double check all the numbers.  After I decided to go with RoundPoint, they changed the initial offer by charging more fees.  Again, I choose to go with them because I was most comfortable with them but this definitely made be pay closer attention to the rest of the paperwork.  There were a few things here and there (could have been computer or human error) that I caught but RoundPoint corrected those along the way.  I guess this can happen with any bank, so I would recommend to check everything!\n\nI was on the fence about the updated rating but overall gave the 4 based on RoundPoint resolving my issues and promptly taking action.  I feel the added stress and aggravation would have been nice to avoid in the first place but what's important is it was addressed and everything is done now.",

The location has plenty of tables or various shapes and sizes for meet ups, relaxation and studying. \n\nI wish that I had the Barista's name that had waited on me this evening-the location closes at 7pm and during the summer months does not seem to be very busy, as the University is not in session. I arrived around 6pm and asked for my usual-a Grande Pike Place, no cream or sugar. The Barista apologized as they had no brew left-while there was only an hour left for the location to be open, he ended up brewing a fresh pot just for me! How nice-I have to thank him for helping me to get through my evening class today. \n\nMy only complaint is that for a passer by in a vehicle, the location is a little bit hard to get in and out of - I ended up parking across the street on 5th avenue and running through traffic to get into the coffee shop. As a student, however, this is a prime location as you can stop on your way to and from class on the east side of campus.",

I whipped out my crappy Spanish, and he didn't seem bothered, which was nice (some people get offended when you try to speak their language and fail...whoops). \n\nI ordered a coffee and my fiance ordered the tamarindo. By the time we got our drinks, we were ready to order. My coffee was tiny! It looked like it was served in a tea set or something, it was kinda cute. Then I noticed the other patrons beside us also ordered coffee and got two regular sized cups...what?\n\nOur food came out relatively fast for homemade food. We both had scrambled eggs (with tomatoes and onions), fresh sliced avocado, and fried plantains. My fiance's food came with refried beans and crema (cream), while mine came with casamientos (whole beans and rice, mixed together). Both were really delicious. They also brought us some tortillas hecho a mano (hand made), which were delicous and perfectly cooked. Mine also came with chorizo (Mexican sausage) but it was one tiny little piece; not significant enough for the price jump between the two dishes. \n\nDownside? With my tiny cup of coffee, I finished it well before halfway done with my food. They didn't come to check on us for a while, and by the time they did, I was really thirsty. They had to make a fresh pot of coffee, understandable in the mornings, but then the guy spilled it all over the table and saucer and cup and then left....wtf? Thought this was kinda funny, seeing as I would have offered a napkin or a new saucer or wiped it up....\n\nOverall the food and coffee (what I drank) was delicious. Would have liked them to check on us a bit more regarding refills (I drank half of my fiance's tamarindo while waiting for more coffee, and they never gave him anymore either, or offered us water; didn't give us an opportunity to ask either, after the coffee incident). We were waiting for the check for a few minutes after we finished, stacked the plates and piled up the mess, went to the restroom, etc. and they never came. We waited until we saw another guest walk up to the register, and decided to head up front too, though its a bit odd for a sit down restaurant. \n\nWould come again for the food, but will be prepared to ask for refills in advance and specify what you want (I thought the sausage would have been different; I should have asked, shame on me). I do recommend the food. I usually can't bear to eat eggs (because they taste or smell funny to me) but these were great. Job well done.",

    "text": "DA EVITARE!\nMy husband is Italian and we just moved 2 years ago from Milan to the States. Portofino was by far the worst Italian restaurant we have been in a while.They try to modify traditional Italian plates to a more sophisticated version putting a high price label on it. We had the lasagne which was burned, cold and with ingredients that don't go with it. The spaghetti carbonara had a strange taste. The gnocchi were warmed up and not fresh at all.\nThe atmosphere is snob and tries to attract the rich ones thinking to find a great Italian spot. There are better places to spend your time and money.\nOne star because the wine was good. At least they know to choose the wine.",

    "text": "After much hype and reading the reviews, I decided to go here with my friends for. A nice Friday evening out. To be honest, it was disappointing. We were there early, and I always wondered why there was a line out the door. The reason being that you order and pay up front and hope they have a table. The menu is a giant chalkboard that is kind of hard to read. We luckily were one of a few groups there so we didn't have any trouble. \n\nWe got 3 entrees for 3 people. The Large Shrimp, Pork Chop, and the Lamb Shank. We did not get any drinks, sides: or apps. Our total bill before tip $55.00. Now after paying that much, sitting at the table, and getting the sauces. Our food came. The pork chop was a nice portion size that came with a little salad. The lamb shank was a small size that came with some orzo, and the shrimp. 10 little shrimp. Was the food tasty---yes. Was it worth the money? That's another story.\n\nNow listen, I cook a variety of dishes regularly. I' m a novice baker. I'm a foodie and appreciate great tasting food. I understand that portion sizes may be smaller at some places. I have paid for small portions and felt that it was worth the money. But for $18 and to get 10 shrimp that is supposed to be an entree (aka main course)--no matter how good is disheartening. Everyone of us was not satisfied. We all left hungry. \n\nIn short--expect a wait, expect to drop a pretty penny, and don't order the shrimp.",

We love the Palazzo and have never had a bad experience here and figured we couldn't go wrong.  However, this is my least favorite dining expereince I've had to the Venetian or Palazzo.\n\nSushiSamba was having their happy hour on Friday 4-7.  We sat up at the bar and ordered off their happy hour menu.  We each decided to try the Caipirinhas.  I'd equate this to a Brazilian margarita.  I think the bartender said it has rum instead of tequila???  Not positive though.  She hands the drinks to us and says something to the effect of \"This isn't my favorite drink, but it gets the job done\".  We didn't ask her if it was a good, bad or indifferent drink.  We just wanted to try something off their happy hour menu that we'd never tried before.  I thought it was a rather odd comment to make.  Then when we tried it, we weren't crazy about it either.  If she was going to say something, she should've told us when we ordered.  Regardless, the drink kind of grew on us.  Didn't order a second and probably won't order the drink again, but it wasn't horrible.\n\nAs far as food, we tried the chicken anticuchos, shrimp tempura roll, salmon taquitos and yellowtail seviche.  Chicken anticuchos were good....basically a chicken skewer with teriyaki.  Shrimp tempura roll was average.  Salmon taquitos were kind of strange...if you do order these, make sure to put the spicy sauce on them.  Without the sauce, they aren't very good.  Last but not least, the dish I truly enjoyed was the yellowtail seviche.  The yellowtail was buttery and spicy all at the same time....very good.\n\nAll said and done, our tab was just under $40 before tip.  Not bad.  However, there was something about this place, I don't see myself ever coming back here.  Other than the yellowtail, nothing was that good.  Average to mediocre at best.",

I went to have lunch there with my friend and when we walked in the hostess was just looking around and so we waited in the doorway for a second and then I said \"hi there\", again she was doing nothing but looking around.. So I finally said \"hi, 2 please\" and she did not even respond, she just picked up menus and so we followed her to our table. Then we sat at our table for I'm not even joking atleast 10 mins. We saw 6 girl servers walking around the almost empty restaurant and none of them ever acknowledged us. I would have gone to ask the hostess if we had a server but she so clearly hated her job that I knew she would be no help. Finally the pack of 6 servers were standing together and I hear one of them go \"who has that table\" and all the girls just look at each other. One of them finally comes up to our table and says sorry she was caught up outside and she will be our server. We give her our drink order and ask to order our food now as well. (Obviously we were ready to order since we had just been starring at our menus for 15 minutes). The server did not seem happy about this. So we order an appetizer and our entr??es and the girl walked away. After about 5 minutes a different server comes and drops off our drinks. And later a different server brings our appetizer while our server is following behind her with our entr??es. While it was nice that our food came out quick, we would have obviously wanted a little time to enjoy the appetizer so our entr??es wouldn't have to sit there and get cold. Our server never came back the entire time that we ate, both of our drinks were empty. The food there is spicy, so obviously you want a drink while you're eating. The server finally came back at the end when we were almost done with all of our food and asked if we were ready for the checks, never even offering to give us refills. Overall it was just a horrible experience. The staff there either just hate their jobs or don't care at all about having a sense of urgency... also maybe the servers should just have an inside or outside section, not both considering they can't seem to remember where all their tables are. Never again will we try this place. Such a disappointment.",

We ordered the 'Chile Relleno' empanadas, Oven Braised Chicken Meatballs, a Flatbread of some sort and a nice bottle of pinot. The wine was great; I have nothing but praise for our wine! As for the empanadas, I think I could get better frozen empanadas from Trader Joes. They're ok if you want that frozen, heated in a convection oven type of a meal- which I do sometimes, but just not at top dollar. The meatballs were ok, a little hard- like maybe they put too much bread crumbs in the mix. They weren't the worst, but they had a sort of golf ball element to them. The flatbread was good, because hey- how can you screw up bread? \n\nI think this place is great to come for a cocktail hour or a glass of wine at the bar while you wait for a table to open up next door.

    "text": "I have decided that I need to be writing more reviews since I base so many of my experiences on what other Yelpers have to say yet I have never sat down to write a review myself. This Vet is going to change that.\n\nI could easily go on and on about how amazing this place is, but it would inevitably repeat what many others have said so I'll try to make it short...ish.\n\nAfter being TERRIBLY dissatisfied with The Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic I seeked the guidance of Yelpers to help me find a new Vet for my dog Slapshot who was having a mixture of issues with arthritis and stomach problems. After reading so many good reviews of BCVC and comparing them to various great reviews for other places, my gut instinct (and the feeling that BCVC treats 1st time visitors with love and care; many other places have good reviews from folks going there for 20 years. That doesn't help me determine how they are with 1st time visitors) led me to give them a try. BOY am I glad I did!! I called one morning and they were able to get me in that afternoon with Dr. Ryan. She is a GODSEND when compared to the many vets I have visited in the past. She is kind, honest, INCREDIBLY caring, and she understands folks being in financial distress. I dont make much money, so when it's time to go to the vet, I get that queezy, I'm-about-to-spend-$400 feeling in my stomach. Not anymore. After thoroughly checking out Slap's symptoms and actually LISTENING to what I had to say, Dr. Ryan printed out a quote and went through each and every option with me. We decided what was best to do now and what could wait. The quote was for over $400 and I left, HAPPILY spending $179 (X-Rays & Exam), despite the potential that Slapshot may have a life-threatening tumor. She was so thorough and caring that she wanted me to give her a call the next week to bring Slap by so she could feel the tumor and see if it was growing or shrinking, free of cost and appointment. All I had to do was call to make sure she was there and I could stop by.\n\nTurns out, Slap was having some issues with the aspirin we started giving him for his arthritis and after 2 weeks, he was acting kinda strange. We called and talked to Dr. Ryan and she wanted to set up a formal appointment to make sure she had the time to do a thorough exam. After an in-depth exam, we have noticed a decrease in the tumor size and believe the intestinal problems were due to the aspirin. She prescribed 2 pills to help clear out his GI Tract as well as Tramadal for his arthritis as it will not have the harmful side effects of aspirin. (Despite prescribing 3 medications, she is very fond of providing over-the-counter and \"natural\" forms of relief. Foods you can feed, etc. in hopes of avoiding unnecessary medications, so those who feel like they are always bombarded by \" your dog NEEDS to take THESE pills\" will feel great comfort with Dr. Ryan)\n\nWhen we were paying at the counter (which, I forgot to mentioned is staffed with awesome, caring, genuine people who you cant help but smile around and feel like even THEY care passionately about your animal) we were given the total of $42 for the 3 different pills and told that the visit fee had been waved by Dr. Ryan bc she wanted us to come in formally vs just stopping by for a quick check. How can you not LOVE THAT!?!?\n\nOk, I lied, this isn't a short review, but I just had to tell my story and this is only the surface of it. Long story short. I have NEVER been so happy with ANY Dr experience in my life. And quite honestly, if I go there and face $400 of work to make Slap better, I wont question her judgement one bit bc I KNOW she only has OUR (myself, Slapshot, and MY wallet) BEST interest at heart. She knows how much money things are and if she tells me that I NEED to pay for it, I will. I have yet to walk out that door with ANY REGRET.\n\nI can't speak for any of the other Dr's (although everyone who comes in for care seems to leave the same way I do), but trust me when I say that Dr. Ryan is AWESOME and if you are looking to find a new vet, you should ABSOLUTELY give her a shot!! And the place is clean and bright and the staff is AWESOME and they offer treats and kisses (for the dogs) as you pay your not-as-high-as-every-other-vet-bill. Not sure of the general exam cost but I want to say it is $45 compared to the +/- $65 that I was charged at Scottsdale Vet Clinic (and a few others that I had called in the past). That alone is worth giving them a visit. Dr. Ryan and staff will do the rest of the convincing themselves!!\n\n10 STARS and 4 PAWS UP!!!  Thank You Dr. Ryan & Blue Cross Staff, I have my vet for life!! \n\n- Dustin F. and Slapshot...F.",

Second, we arrived at 6:30, can't recall when our drinks arrived (7PM?) but our first plates ($3 for 6 SMALL pieces of bread) arrived at 7:20.  The second round of plates arrived at 7:40.  Grits and an egg, which was good but strange.  The bread was long gone, so there I am eating just grits, and an egg.  The third round arrived at 8 PM.  I got the mac & cheese, which was cold; not lukewarm, COLD.   I got heartburn --- probably from drinking beer on an empty stomach and the weird parings becasue who eats grits and an egg on a Friday night and 20 minutes later cold mac & cheese?  Also got a sore throat from shouting and my clothes smelled like I had been in a cheap diner.  (But of course this place is pretty expensive, given the small portions.)  Oh, the wait staff -- there were four or five different people throughout the evening taking our order, bringing food and drinks clearing stuff away -- who is our server?  Who's service do we base our tip on?  They got orders mixed up, who get's what again now? I found it discombobulating.  Bottom line, I did not enjoy the expereince at all.",

I was very nervous as I had a very large granite project that required 6 slabs of granite...Full backsplash kitchen, bar, oversized island, and very, very long bathroom vanities that required true mastery.  Joe told me that they are \"the best\" and not to worry...boy was he ever right!  To say the least, they are by far the best I have seen, and I have remodeled many homes with different granite contractors...the project was perfectly done and is gorgeous.  I will never use anyone else again for home improvements.  From being on time, to communication, to professionalism, to true craftsmanship, Optimum Home Soultions has it all.  THANK YOU from a very happy customer.",

    "text": "I would have to say that I havent ever been that picky about getting my nails done. I have been loyal to an establishment once I get in there and see what the talent available is there. In san diego I was with the same salon for 8 years but in that 8 years I did find the one person I truly liked having my nails done by so I followed her to her own shop making our time together much longer. So in saying that, I havent been in Vegas long enough to setup more than an establishment loyalty.\nThen I met Sasha. I had been going to a salon here for a while but I guess I was somewhat tired of feeling like a number and getting frustrated with intermittent shotty nails that would last a month one time and then fall off 2 days after getting them done other times. I found Sasha through yelp and others working in the Icon Salon and after seeing her work and verbally hearing her praises I decided to get an appointment and try her on for size. Sasha is very talented when it comes to nails. She uses the gels (which I hadnt ever done before and was seriously skeptical of because I am seemingly hard on my nails). She does 3D artwork and shes open to new designs and suggestions. She prefers her clients to be somewhat knowledgeable of what they are asking for from her as an artist. She doesnt use the dremel looking sander to prep the nail for fills, rather she uses just a nail file. This is beneficial to your nails as it doesnt dig down into the bed of the nail and cause the nails to be so thin and brittle. This is a huge advantage for me in that I have been wearing nails since I was about 20.\nI highly recommend Sasha as she is easy to get along with and you will be getting quality nails by choosing her as your \"Master Nail Specialist\" (yep, made that one up!).",

I also tried the crunchy spam musubi and I'm normally a person who just likes to stick to the regular musubi but wow this one was a game changer. There's a pink sauce on it that tastes so good and the crunch of the breaded spam was on point! I also tasted a garlic shrimp from my boyfriends plate and thought that was close to the garlic shrimp from Hawaii. Lastly I tried the Ube and pineapple ice cream in a Keiki cup and the flavor was delicious! Totally recommend making room for that after your meal. The shop itself was very clean and ascetically pleasing reminded me of home. The workers were so friendly always checking up on my family and I. 14/10 recommend coming here and spreading the aloha! I'll be back for sure!",

I was concerned because there were no empty tables. We waited outside for a few minutes for a table to clear and were seat around 7:15 or so. I highly recommend making a reservation because it was packed on a week day night!

    "text": "Decent quality for the price.\n\nI ordered one of the company's much talked about photo books shortly after Christmas. I uploaded the photos from my phone via the Shutterfly app and after filling out the billing and shipping info, I know that I had probably only spent a handful of minutes designing the look and feel of my book. Seriously, my part was done and over with after maybe four minutes and then I called it a day. I didn't put much effort forth in creating my \"masterpiece,\" so I didn't know what to expect. I'd never used Shutterfly before this, but the process seemed pretty quick and painless, not to mention fairly inexpensive, so I was down for it. After all, I didn't spend hours copiously designing fancy borders and all for my book, so maybe my expectations were not ridiculously high.\n\nI received my book in the mail before the estimated ship date, which meant the turnaround was  about 8-9 days. I thought that post-Christmas, the timing seemed pretty reasonable.  Overall, I was pleased with the majority of the book. The cover looked great and most of the pictures came out quite well. However, two of the photos that I uploaded from my Iphone that looked exquisite as they were didn't come out so well. For some reason, they were not cropped appropriately or anything. It's like they just cut off at the bottom. I don't understand it and I was rather looking forward to seeing those two photos in my photo book as they appeared in their original form, but unfortunately, the shots (which were selfies) don't look like they do on my phone or on FB or Instagram, where I also uploaded them.\n\nI'm disappointed by that and had no idea that they would turn out like that. Did I need to crop them myself or was that the fault of Shutterfly? I truly don't know, but either way, I don't see why the perfectly gorgeous photos were laid out as they were on the pages when they don't look like that in my phone or when I printed them from FB. Weird.\n\nThe rest of the photos looked high quality and the pages were laid out in the order in which the pics were uploaded to the app. I was pleased with the rest of the book, the cover came out just as I hoped it would and the overall price of the book wasn't bad (retails for $29.99 and up), especially with the first time user discount applied to it. Still, those two shots that were haphazardly chopped off do stick out like a sore thumb. \n\nOne odd thing that I noticed, though? The photo book pages have a rather distinctive, fairly strong smell to them that I hope will dissipate with time. \n\nWill I use the Shutterfly app/website to order more products in the future? I'm willing to give them another try. I still like the overall product and the process is as easy as can be. I'm a busy girl, so something that is that user-friendly always gets points with me.",

It gets a bit crowded on Fridays, Saturdays and some random weekdays too and has a great vibe during the slower days of the week as well.  I love the old wooden door that is now a large table in the middle of the place, great style.    \n\nBeer selection is always well varied and it's rare I can'y find something I'm happy with.  The food is great and some of my favorites are the pork belly tacos, the reuben, broccoli slaw and french fries, best in the neighborhood.  One of the few places in town with cask beer and a real beer engine. They sell a good bit of it so it's always fresh.  Check out the specials on the off nights, really good deals.  \n\nIf you are looking for a Cheers, this might it.  Had I not recently moved I might not be writing this review as I didn't want this place to get any busier. \n\nI almost forgot, the oysters are fantastic and a surprise for this place.  Would never had guessed it.  Get an oyster shot if you're brave enough, they are outstanding.  Oh, did I mention free popcorn too?!?\n\n***  I live in the middle of NODA and have been everywhere in the neighborhood many times over the past years. These reviews are a culmination of lots of visits so it's more of a consistency rating than anything.

    "text": "*4.5 stars* (I'm getting really mean with my 5 star reviews)\n\nWithin approximately 5 minutes of entering Bang Fitness I was flat on my back on the turf while a bearded man palpated the bony prominences of my pelvis. And you know what? I liked it. That's not because of a case of pogonophilia (Google it-it's real!) but because this was Geoff, the owner of the gym, and he wanted to see if I was physically OK to do the class I'd signed up for. Somebody actually cared enough to ask about injuries and experience before just taking my crumpled deal voucher and running.\n\nThey say they do things differently at Bang, and that was evident even before I first arrived. I had bought a Groupon for classes, and in typical fashion left it until it was near expiry to use. They were prompt in answering emails and after a few failed attempts I eventually made it in for my first class. I was a bit confused by the setup intially. It's on the second floor and I could mainly see an MMA gym. It turns out that the MMA bit is on the left and Bang is in the same space on the right after you round the initial corner. You have to take your shoes off when you walk in the door and in the changing rooms so I erred on the side of caution and brought indoor shoes. You can often work out barefoot or in socks too. \n\nThe strangest thing about Bang is the people who work there. They're all incredibly nice and friendly. They learn your name and remember it. They know when you've been in and what you've done. They notice if your form slips and correct it. They increase the intensity if it looks like it's too easy. They are all super enthusiastic about getting you moving well and avoiding injury. It's like physio and a kick-ass gym combined. I felt like I was being welcomed into a family!\n\nMost of the classes I did were with Steve-kettlebells and Friday morning kick-ass conditioning. I absolutely adored and still adore these classes. Sizes are generally small (max 12, often less). They are always challenging but always fun and you absolutely will get fitter. I will probably always maintain that it's a good idea to actually learn some basic kettlebell techniques before trying a class anywhere; but they do correct form at Bang. The KB class is usually 5 exercises for 3 sets; then a second set of 5 for 3 sets before tabatas. Izumi Tabata is a Japanese researcher who was part of a group that came up with the bright idea of trying to kill you for 20 seconds followed by 10 seconds of rest for 8 cycles. I looked him up on Google images to see if I could get revenge. He looks innocuous so I could probably take him. I'd have no hope of taking Steve down unless he tripped over me. He's a strong guy. To be fair though, they're worth doing-they've been proven to increase conditioning. And the guys here are all about the research. \n\nKick-ass conditioning is different every week. I just love it because I never know what to expect. It's circuit style and I've done stuff like hit a tire with a sledgehammer, I've pulled and pushed a sled, done box jumps, slammed medicine balls and carried a keg.  You never know what's in store but it is always fun and it is always a great workout. It cures any inner rage. Steve is funny and the time just flies.\n\nI did one Olympic lifting class. I was terrible but Ron was lovely. He was so patient, the class was small and technique was heavily emphasized. It's a pity it just didn't fit with my schedule to go to more.\n\nI did one circuit class with Andy on a Monday which was different again-band work, kettlebells, lunges. I knew I'd been working the next day!\n\nI decided on a trial month which included a programme and 3 semi-private coaching sessions. They do a full assessment on you including a functional movement screen and devise a programme to fix deficiencies and help towards your goals. I tried some exercises I had never done before and got lots of useful tips and corrections on things I'd been doing for a while. I'm even trying to put my shoulders down where they should be while I type now. My nutrition consultation was mercifully brief-I basically said I knew I was eating badly anyway. We discussed more habit-based nutrition tips which was nice and has made more of a difference than if they had just handed me a diet plan and expected me to stick to it. As if! I'm excellent at ignoring diet plans. \n\nI ran out of space to say more but agree with the other reviewers (also read filtered)!\n\nAt the moment, my plan is to sign up for a class card because it doesn't suit me time or money-wise to get membership. I'm not willing to leave the place yet though and enjoy the classes far too much to not go again. And I'm not usually a group exercise type! Definitely go, check the place out. Do a drop-in class, have a look around, consider a trial month. Doing things differently is exactly what is needed!\n\n(P.S.: Surprise bonus was checking in on Yelp and being informed that I was the \"Duchess of Bang\". If only Yelp awarded certificates..)",

    "text": "The ambiance was great. The food was okay. The service was absolutely terrible. I have a gluten allergy and when an order came with the pork marinated with beer, which wasn't mentioned on the menu, (tastes awesome, but will kill me) the waiter offered to get me a different order. He was really nice, and I ordered chicken instead, thanked him profusely. The new order looked like someone had just dumped ingredients in a pile, chicken was dry and flavorless. Later in the evening, he came by and actually stood with his back to me and faced my friend to ask him how everything was, and not me. Refused to refill our water. I tipped over 20% on our total order to show my appreciation for his extra help, despite the weirdness -- totally understand that allergies can be annoying for wait staff. When he put our extra food in a box, he dumped everything upside down. I would recommend using caution with this one. I've had fine experiences here in the past, but this was a deal breaker for me.",

Pizza is definitely not for those who are lactose intolerant and they douse the pizza with what seems like a half pound of fresh mozzarella, but it's an amazing treat.  They sell the pizza by the slice, but its not as good as when you order an entire pizza where they bury all the toppings under the cheese.  There must be something about everything baking together that makes it taste so good.  They've been in business for 50 years now so I'm\"m definitely in the majority on this one.\n\nAnd yeah, shop hasn't been renovated in decades and the photos of the toddlers on the wall are grown and probably have their own toddlers, but to me it's apart of the charm.

This place is disappointingly average.\n\nWe ordered jajiang mein, jampong and Gan Peng Ji.\n\nJajiang mein..sauce average.  Noodle was in one big klump, which means it was sitting there for a while before they brought it out.  In my opinion these noodles should be al dente (as the Italians would say) or QQ ( as the taiwanese would day) or chewy and springy (as Mike K) would say.  You guessed it...these noodles are not. \n\nJam Pong.  I got the non spicey since my stomach has betrayed me and I can't eat spicey now.  But even with no spice this broth was excellent.  But the noodles....just like the jajiang mein..has no body or chew.\n\nGan Peng Ji.  I don't understand all these places that make it with a tomato paste.  It's supposed to be a soy garlic sauce. Here they make it with tomato paste.  Not only is it not good..but really over priced.  Normally korean restaurants give you a big portion of this even if it's not good..but here..small for $14.99.\n\nOn the really positive side...really good service..",

    "text": "The restaurant is sparkling with nice furniture and a definitely eye catchy bar. The moment you step inside, it does appeal you giving you a sense of cleanliness and luxury. Once you are seated in your table, you get this cramped feeling - obviously the restaurant is a bit smaller and has packed more tables than it should. You are provided with bread and oregano as a free appetizer. Not very appetizing, would have loved if they had hummus instead. The menu gives you a variety of Mediterranean options with some sandwich options that may be for the not so adventurous patrons. The options are indeed fun with a twist. The Arrarat cutlet gets a definite vote of innovation from me - a chicken hot pocket packed with spinach and mushrooms! The food came in with an extra delay than you would normally wait for. I could relate the delay with the 'now hiring' sign posted on the outside door. The food wasn't so bad - but it didn't really seem like a carefully orchestrated menu. You can order three sides from hummus, veg Salad, rice, French fries or mashed potatoes. Except for veg salad and rice, I found it rather difficult accompanies to meat. Are you supposed to choke down on the hummus or mashed potatoes? The French fries are not your regular American fries - I found them rather larger chunks of unappetizing steamed or baked potatoes. For a cuisine known for their meats, found that their chicken or lamb was not succulent and juice. They were much more hard and rubbery, it does definitely become a struggle point of your meal. The portions are good but it's on the pricey side - about 35-40$ for two with just entrees.\n\nSumming up Arrarat definitely tries to set itself apart from other Mediterranean restaurants by giving a great ambience and styling, with an innovative menu. With all that well done, the food is not top of its class.",

    "text": "PRIX FIX MENU: http://www.mgmgrand.com/pdf/menu_robuchon_prixfixe.pdf\n\nThe menu on YELP is very confusing.\nDine in date: July 30, 2014\n\nWe chose Menu A $250 (l'amuse bouche, 2 apps, 2 main courses, 1 dessert, a seductive sweet cart), the cheese trolley was extra so I'm not sure why they have it on the above link.  Also, sometimes they change their menu around (I think).\n\nL'amuse-bouche: something with kale\nit was just average\n\nCOLD APPS:\nL'oursin - sea urchin in orange vinaigrette, delicate gelee of green asparagus with turmeric.\nLe Crabe Royale - Alaskan King crab, salad of avocado & tomato in a heart of romaine & olive oil.\n\nI got the sea urchin, my partner got the king crab; I don't recommend the sea urchin.  I don't like to the fact that it seems like you can taste the fishiness.  If you like Chinese bamboo shoots that smells like cow fertilizer or urine, then try it...but I don't like it.  \n\nHOT APPS:\nLe Foie Gras de Canard - Grilled foie gras, bell pepper confit in acacia honey.\nL'oeuf de Poule - Deep-fried boiled eggs in light Comte cheese sauce with iberico de bellota ham. \n\nFoie gras was cook to perfection, this was awesomely delicious...my mouth is watering as I'm typing this review reminiscing the taste of the perfect foie gras in my mouth.\n\nI can't remember if I like the deep-fried boiled eggs.\n\nMAIN COURSES:\n\nLa Langouste - Spiny lobster roasted in a shellfish jus with spinach leaves and lemongrass emulsion.\nLe Bar - Pan seared sea bass in salted butter with baby artichoke sauce.\n\nBoth tasted delicious.  My partner LOOOOVEd his sea bass more than my lobster.\n\nLe Boeuf - Beef cheeks braised with eggplant in red miso & ginger sauce, medley of bell peppers\nLe Poulet Fermier - Caramelized farm chicken with foie gras, farro risotto with snow peas.\n\nBeef cheeks were tender, my partner didn't care for his chicken dish because he was expecting the foie gras he tasted from mine. \n\nDESSERTS:\n\nLes Herbes - Green chartreuse sabayon topped with herb sorbet & a hazelnut praline\nL'Abricot - Sugar pearl filled with apricots & panna cotta, cubes of seasonal fruit gelee with verbena.\n\nLes Herbes was the winner on this one.  The L'Abricot was too citrusy for me. \n\nMignardises - seductive sweets trolley \nI asked for 1 of each but they told me only 5/ person can choose 1, so we had 10 different things.  Surprisingly, I didn't like the macaroons.  Creme Brulee was OK...I didn't care for a lot of the sweets they offered on their trolley.\n\nOVERALL, if you have the money, won a lot of money, love french food, just want to try fine dining or in vegas; then you should try it, after all it's the only 3 Michelin star restaurant in Vegas.  \nI like how they give the diners the freedom to choose whatever you like instead of 1 table getting the same kind of menu or chefs tasting.  So yes, if you prefer getting a main course while the other party at your table is getting 11 courses so you can pick on theirs then you're allowed; different than Melisse & Providence.\n\nI'm giving this a 4 star because I was famish upon our arrival and was experiencing hunger pains.   The service of just giving us a menu took too long.  They also messed up on our bill & charged us an extra $169, but they corrected that error.  Everyone will have different experiences.  I'd definitely would like to come back and just order the foie gras & maybe try other things depending how much I win at the table.",

    "text": "Absolutely bewildered at the high ratings for these places across the valley. Wife and I decided to pick up some food from the Blue Diamond location because our new favourite for \"quick and honest\" Mexican fare, Phat Phranks, is closed on weekends.\n\nAs I watched them build my burritos my heart sank and I knew I wasn't going to be in for a pleasant experience. The meat was wet, beans were swimming in goo and the tortillas split from the wetness as they wrapped it. My wife's bean and cheese burrito was even worse - 48.5% rice, 48.5% wet beans, 1% of a tiny sprinkle of cheese.\n\nWhen we went to eat our meals the burritos were predictably soggy, vaguely unpleasant tasting -- revolting beans -- and generally yucky. I found it just edible and would rate the place 1 and a half stars overall, rounding down because it's a bit overpriced and I just didn't enjoy the taste.",

My husband and I have tried something different each time. \n\nI am writing this review because Noodlehead does NOT have a phone or I would have called to talk to a manager. I went to the restaurant today. As I waited for my order, I witnessed a waitress/hostess with long blonde hair (few dread locks in the back) who was so terribly rude/mean/disrespectful to several customers. She threw her hands in the air to a lady who was inquiring about a few empty tables and said very rudely and loudly and in the lady's face, \"Be My Guest, take the table!  It is meant for larger parties, but go ahead and do what you want\" And then she threw a glass bottle with such force into the garbage can where I was sitting, it broke in the can. Next, several men were standing in her way and she very rudely said, \"move over there, you are directly in my way\"... Not, \"excuse me\"..  \n\nCustomer service and good food go hand in hand. I hope the people who pay her to work for them know how she is treating THEIR paying customers!   I am giving a 2 because of the atmosphere today. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed for the customers.",

There are far too many other options in Madison and the surrounding area for top quality steak houses. \n \nThe NY Strip was average at best and over priced- at $28.00. It lacked real strip flavor and if it was charcoal grilled- it certainly wasn't evident. \n\nThe 6oz Salmon was also over priced at $30.00 but that was complimented by also being over cooked and not very fresh. That one-two punch was covered up by cooking it on a cedar plank and drowning the fish in a cranberry relish.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner about a month ago on a Friday night with my family of 5. The restaurant was a small place, and it was busy, but we were seated in about 10 minutes without a reservation. I've been here a few times and have had a good experience consistently. \n\nWe were craving sushi, so we ordered a huge boat of sushi. We were each given a small bowl of salad and miso soup soon afterwards. The soup didn't have that msg aftertaste you'd find at some places, and the dressing on the salad was just right; not too sour, not too sweet, not too bland, not too much. The sushi came in about 10 minutes, and for the amount that we ordered, that was pretty fast. We had an assortment of raw fish, including no tuna and hamachi, as well as raw squid, avocado, and sea urchin. All of it tasted fresh and delicious. The sushi didn't have too much rice like some places, and the fish servings were adequate. We also got a soft shell crab roll, which had avocado, cucumber and cream cheese. My family didn't like the cream cheese in it but I thought it was good so I ate all of it.\n\nWhat I find stood out to me was that every time I've went with my family, they always bring us something random that's on the house. I'm not sure if that's something they do often or just with larger groups. They use \"scrap\" pieces of fish such as the bits of meat missed when filleting a fish and make it into something delicious. This time, they made a hot dish of salmon pieces with onions, bean sprouts, carrots and sauce. The salmon was done well but had bones in it. It was free though so I can't really complain. It's a nice touch, and I like the idea of not wasting food. \n\nOverall, this is probably one of my favourite sushi restaurants and I'd definitely come back another time.",

    "text": "So this is a unique property. The staff was very good and friendly despite staying there Christmas Eve. The event rooms are incredibly amazing, if I lived in Cleveland I would try to find an excuse to use them. Our room was clean and well prepared. The interior decorating is modern in style, which is fine, but poorly executed. For example there is no actual door in the suites between rooms. This is a problem when the whole reason you booked a suite was so that the baby could sleep undisturbed in the other room. beyond that, lots of weird choices: the couch requires that you recline at 45 degrees which is very awkward, the trashcans are about one liter in size, the water doesn't stay in the sink, the fancy faucets are difficult to turn on/off one-handed, etc. Looks very nice and I really appreciate the bare floors. See other posts about parking. \n\nBasically this will be great for you UNLESS one of the very odd choices by the decorator is a trigger for you. The strangest thing is that all their problems arise from spending too much without thought rather than going the cheap and obvious route.",

    "text": "Such a horrible experience in buying a car.  I have bought many cars and this dealer is the epitome of shady used car sales. I looked at Prius V due to the price hanging from the rearview mirror.  When the salesman Chris C came out he said, oh that is not the correct price and told me it was $6000 more. I did not buy because I wanted to think about it longer since the price was drastically different.  I went back a week later and the car was still there with the adjusted price in it. I asked if they could go a little lower on the price.  He asked me to sign the quote if I bought it that day. I did.  He came back and he did not go as low as I wanted but was close.  I decided to go with the car.  He put all the papers together and gave my paperwork to the finance guy, Stratos. I told them I didn't have the title for my car but that I could bring it in.  Stratos said that was fine, it wouldn't make a difference.  I could take home the Prius and leave my trade in there. I brought the title at 9am the next morning. IT ACTUALLY DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I looked at my paperwork and they did not include the trade so I was charged tax on the entire transaction over $900 more, not the tax that they quoted me.  They also did not sell me for the agreed on price.  When I went back in to question this, ironically, no one could find the quote that I signed.  It miraculously has disappeared. When questioning the tax they said it was because I didn't have the title.  We asked to speak to the manager, TJ, and he wouldn't meet with us.  Instead, they said Statos out that said he works a lot of deals and we got a good deal.  He said that the quoted price was also not given since I didn't have the title when I did the paperwork.  Again, IT ACTUALLY DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE. It was a loss of over $1400.  He said that they did the paperwork right away to secure the car for me. It had already sat for over a week. Instead of telling me that they were changing everything, they proceeded with the paperwork without telling me. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  Go to the other Toyota dealership in town or somewhere else altogether.",

    "text": "Update: After my somewhat favorable review, I've lowered the rating after staying here this past weekend. My friends and I decided to leave after one night b/c our room developed this \"pee\" smell -- which made us rename the place, the Imperial Pee-lace. \n\nHowever, I do need to mention our friends had the room next door and didn't have a pee-problem. The people in my room insist that no one peed on the floor, but now I'm beginning to wonder....\n\nOriginal Review: \nOkay, so the Imperial Palace is definitely not the swankiest, nor the newest, nor the funnest place to go in Vegas. But it has one kitschy, old Vegas thing going for it - the Dealertainers. Don't get me wrong, it's not for everyone, but I love it. After a while, all those new places start to feel the same, look the same. The Dealertainers are black jack dealers that are tier 2 (okay maybe 3) level impersonators. They all deal cards and take turns going up on the mini stage to belt out songs - mental note, look for the speakers and DON'T sit in front of them. I had the pleasure of playing cards with Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder, Debbie Harry, Louis Armstrong, Billy Idol, and someone who may have been a very bad Mariah Carey (it was unclear). Anyway, go there for a different twist on cards - they had $5 minimum tables on a Saturday night - which is a rare find on the strip.",

Although not melt-in-your mouth like Schwartz's, Corned Beef House has some of the best smoked meat and corned beef I've had outside of Habs Town.\n\nMy fave here is the Reuben, but given the tastiness of the meat, the basic Montreal and corned beef sandwiches are both highly recommended as well. Now I'm just waiting for CBH to team up with the Pizzaiolo downstairs and make a smoked meat pizza!\n\nThese dudes lose half a star as a result of a few small things: prices are JUST too high, they ditched their after-6pm deal after they moved, and their signage is just insufficient for this busy corner.

What's not fine, however, was that four couples bypassed us (there were three of us), and we ended up sitting at a two-person table. Two of us had to basically squeeze into a one person spot. The seating was extremely disorganized, which probably explained why the wait was so long. Customer service was poor, no one apologized for the wait, nor for shoving us into a tiny spot. \n\nFood came half an hour after we were seated.\n\nWe ordered the savory french toast and croissant Benny with peameal bacon (their specials). Overall quality of food was average, definitely not worth the long wait in the cold. The side salad was good though. We also ordered two croissants cos we were starving, the plates that the croissants were served on were hot, so we thought we were getting warm fluffy croissants. However the croissants were cold and hard, guess they've been sitting in their bakery for a while.. \n\nOverall, poor experience with this place, food was really average, I paid 22$, which was pricy given the quality of food and service. \n\n(If you are getting your food packed, make sure you triple check to ensure that you are actually bringing your own food home. I went home, expecting to find my Benny in the bag, and found a half eaten chocolate cake instead. Gross!)",

We usually stay at the Marriott Grand Chateau but decided to stay at a different hotel to save money but we could not check in due to them being booked. \nAnyways, we were exhausted and needed to crash somewhere. The Artisan was the first result on Google and they had vacancies, so we went. \nMy first clue should have been that I've never heard of it. I lived in Vegas for a few months, I drive in from CA all the time. But alas, we went. \nUpon pulling in, there is literally a 15 car parking lot MAX. And it is all valet. That's cool, but the valet is nowhere to be found. No problem, we just want to sleep. We walk in, and it is something. Badly printed art is EVERYWHERE-- the walls, the ceilings. There's a fountain(????), sculptures. Interesting decor to say the least. I give this place two stars ONLY because the guy who checked us in 08/01/2017 was so nice. \nSo we get checked in, we get the car sorted out, we get up the weird red elevator, and to the floor. Also super creepy. Every room is after an artist, I don't remember who ours was, but it was terrifying. The freaky paintings were not my thing. Neither are the 16559854 mismatched mirrors. Not to mention, my 6'4 250lb boyfriend had to body slam the door FOUR TIMES full force before it opened. That shit was STUCK. On the plus side, we weren't worried about being murdered with a door that difficult.  We slept with the lights on. The rooms are small and very run down. Random stuff in the sheets. We slept like planks and prayed we wouldn't get bed bugs or worse. It was super gross. We walked around in shoes the whole night. We didn't even shower. \nAll in all, this may be a cool spot for partying or something, but avoid staying here at all costs. It's in a bad part of town, its nasty, and the only redeeming factor is the people who work here are all very nice.",

I asked her for some time to decide on what I was looking to pick up because I wanted an assorted dozen. (Mmm)\n\nI was given ample time to decide and did not feel rushed in the slightest. So I said I was prepared to order and Maria was there in a jiffy just as prepared if not more prepared than I to take my order. \n\nSo I gave her my order flawlessly and she received in perfectly. I then pull up and she had my total for me at the window. We continued the exchange as any drive thru exchange would continue until the very end. \n\nThis is where Maria really showed that she and her shop are a cut above the rest. She leans out the very narrow drive thru window risking intense sun burn and heat exhaustion in this Arizona (nearly) summer heat to ask me if I need any napkins. I was impressed with her bravery and care. I requested just one napkin because I only thought I would need one. But Maria leaves and swiftly returns with my donuts and hands them over to me and then tells me that she has given me two napkins. Turns out Maria knows me better than I even know myself.

I DONT WANT YOUR INSURANCE. she was rude and useless when we went back. so we spoke to the manager and the manager didn't say one word, just refunded our money. i'm guessing because this happens a lot with that company, people get mad about HIDDEN FEES and the up selling. she refunded our money no problem while the other girl said they can't refund it because it's too late. it wasn't even about the money at this point it was the fact that we felt we got deceived and they were essentially \"stealing\" our money with hidden fees.\non another note, we had only one car to chose from and it was dented/scratched. not a problem, just didn't want to be in fault for it. \nwill never rent here again. thanks \"Dana\" for only making us mad. just feel like this company is dishonest and will lie to your face and also add hidden fees just so they make more commission.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in Vegas this past weekend and wanted to try out the new High Roller to see what it's about. The whole area is new-ish. I'm not sure when it opened up but this was our first time here. The Linq has a lot of restaurants, bars and food shops in the area. We went with my parents as well. On the way to the High Roller, we saw they had kiosks to buy tickets closer to the strip. So we just decided to buy our tickets there to make it faster. We didn't know it at the time, but this saved us a lot of time!\n\nWhen you buy your tickets through the kiosk, you get to pick a time slot of when you want to ride the High Roller. I would suggest giving yourself 20 minutes because it is still a pretty far walk just to get to the High Roller entrance and giving yourself some bathroom time.\n\nThe walkway to the High Roller entrance is where all the shops and restaurants are. There's a lot of music being played in the area. It seems like a really busy place and is a nice place just to stop by and chill.\n\nWhen we got to the High Roller entrance, we saw a long line. Luckily we bought our tickets through the machine and we got to walk right through! So just a tip, purchase your tickets through the kiosk to save yourself some time. When you walk in the workers check purses/bags. Then you walk through the place. It reminds me of disneyland because of the way the lines are setup. We went on a Saturday at 9:10PM. We got really lucky cause we got to walk right through all the way to the top without waiting in any lines. They have an area to use the bathroom and buy drinks. I would suggest to use the bathroom since the ride is 30 minutes long and there's no place to go when you're in the pod. The drinks aren't that expensive. My wife and I tried the frozen drinks with some shots of alch.\n\nYou get grouped with around 20 people. The pods move continuously so you have to enter and exit pretty carefully. The pods have TVs inside that tells you how high you are and when you reach the apex of the ride. It also shows trivia and how the High Roller was made in a time lapse video. The views pretty nice, especially at night! You get to see the strip lit up. It was a super full moon that night as well. We got to see the Bellagio water show for a bit too. The pod has two seating areas. I would say the best place to go to in the pod would be the right side next to the entrance doors when you walk in. It has the best view of the strip when you reach the top. So try to make it out to that area if you can. But pretty much you can walk around the whole pod and enjoy all the views.\n\nI would definitely recommend taking a ride on the High Roller if you're in Vegas. You can ride it during the day but try to go at night as you get to see all the lights Vegas has to offer. It was $35/person at night and cheaper during the day. Not that bad for a really good and fun experience.",

With their new (well new if you haven't been there in about a year) outdoor patio seating, there's more room for a stage and lots of tables and chairs, even couches, to lounge on and let your ears be rocked. \n\nTo be blunt, the place is awesome, the people may be a little rough around the edges but they're nice and the venue has really stepped it up over the years.

    "text": "Ventured outside of North Scottsdale and finally made a trip down to Nook for lunch. Hubby and I were big fans on Tagan and Frank's Amaro in Cave Creek, but sadly, things went way downhill when they left :(  We were eager to see what they came up with in their new digs, and we were over the moon!\n\nFirst of all, just loved the space which is designed with comfort in mind. The spacious semicircle booths which line one side of the room are fabulous. I wish more restaurants understood the concept of the booth! And the bar . . . it has plenty of seating to schmooze up to it, grab a beer, kick back and watch a game with your friends. Nook could be trendy, but it reminds me more of a real neighborhood restaurant and bar, the kind like in my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA.  \n\nThe menu is eclectic, but favors the Italian cuisine. You can choose decadent, like the Arancini, crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, with the best tasting fresh house-pulled mozzarella, or choose healthy, like the halibut tacos or albacore salad. For our first time, we chose decadent - the Arancini was delectable, and the langoustines were sweet and tender while the accompanying sauce had just the perfect bite. Hubby had the scrumptious Black Forest Ham sandwich which came with perfect fries. I couldn't resist the Gamberetti e Funghi pizza (shrimp, enoki mushrooms, parmesan and mozzarella).  I issue a challenge to anyone who says that shrimp doesn't belong on pizza!!!  Our informative and friendly waiter Jorge almost issued the same challenge to me . . . by remarking that he had only taken two orders for that pizza before and both were decidedly thrilled with their choice! The thin crust pizza was spot on . . . a melding of flavors and textures that really worked magic in my mouth. As an aside, I initially wanted to order it with gluten free crust, but they were out of it. I am not gluten-free as a medical necessity, but by choice . . . Nice to know they \"sometimes\" have it. You might want to call ahead to make sure it is available if that's important to you.\n\nWe love that the owners greet you at the door, and that they make time to check in with you, see if you like the food, have opinions, etc. They are eager to make Nook a place for you to call home and feel at home. No doubt we'll be back and bring a bunch of our friends with us!",

I even got raffle tickets to enter the person who referred me here! (That would be my fiance so that means the prize is mine!) They supposedly just started doing that this month! *cross fingers for a new GALAXY TABLET!!* After some new patient paperwork, it wasn't long until I got called back. \n\nFirst I was greeted by a dental assistant who took x-rays of my teeth. (thank you, i forgot your name, but you didn't scratch my gums with those plastic films).\n\nI then met Dr. Pham who was very professional and got straight to work. I was really nervous because I thought I would see the hygenist first! I didn't get a chance to brush my teeth before I walked in (lame, but I know you do it too!) So I was quite alarmed.. But turns out it wasn't so bad. Still wish I saw the hygenist first though!\n\nSo Dr. Pham read out a few things to his assistant in a dental language that I couldn't possibly understand, and then laid it out for me.. I had a few cracked fillings and cavities that needed work on. We'll schedule that up front after my cleaning.\n\nTHEN I then met the hygenist, who thankfully diligently worked on cleaning by teeth without talking to me too much. I don't understand why some people insist on talking to you when you have metal instruments in your mouth! But not here! She recommended a thicker floss and gave me a few samples.\n\nThen I was on my way!\n\nI think I found the right dentist! I guess they are all not so big and scary.. :)\n\n---------------------------\n\nThis next part is after my first dental procedure appointment. I came back to fix 2 cracked fillings. I was SUPER surprised at how fast the visit was.. less than an hour! (I dunno, I haven't been to the dentist in a long time, so is that fast?)\n\nI was also super happy that I got a chance to brush my teeth and floss first *yay!\n\nDr. Pham did an amazing job numbing my mouth. I felt my ears tingle! He was going to give me more numbing juice, but I respectfully declined.. I know, so brave.. I should've just taken more numbing, but I was really hungry and wanted to eat dinner as soon as possible after the appointment. I figured, the less he numbed me, the faster it'll wear off.. lol.. and I was right!\n\nOverall the entire procedure was QUICK and PAINLESS. I had to go back, so hopefully the next procedures are just as easy. \n\n**still crossing my fingers for the Galaxy Tablet**",

Costco should be looking into customer complaints and trust their customers with a different company. Customer phone operator is rude, average technicians at best, when some thing goes wrong due to their own fault they blame some one else and even if you contact them on their Facebook page they don't answer. They are more about selling you services and units but when I needed them to check a noise in my AC and the AC stops working during tinkering around with it they blame the thermostat that they installed in the first place. This is the short version, I sent the. A letter through their face book page for what really happened and I have yet to hear back from them. You wonder how this company is being managed.",

The restroom feels like a summer camp bathroom but a lot cleaner. There is a small game room in the back with a ping pong table and couch and tv. I would love them to have the movie Meatballs on the many tv screens but for the sports fan it works.\nBaskets on table with squeeze bottles like when you are at a picnic.\nFood was good but not impressive.

The drinks were strong and the prices (especially for the quality) were fantastic!!\n\nHubby and I got there close to 4:00 on a Monday night and we were able to get a great spot with a nice view.  By 4:30, the crowd was increasing.  Our waitress was excellent!  I asked for a variation on the drink menu and not only was she accommodating, but she included it as part of the $6.00 HH drink menu!  It was a house-made Skinny Margarita (both hubby and I ordered it) and it was tasty and STRONG!  I had 2 of these delicious drinks, and that was 1 too many!  Yes, I'm a bit of a light weight when it comes to tequila, but still...it was STRONG!!  :-)\n\nFor food, we ordered Guacamole to share (YUM!!!!), hubby had the Filet Mignon Sliders with Blue Cheese (OMG, they were divine!!) and I had the seared Ahi tuna.  The Ahi was good, but it felt weird to eat it with a fork....I have NEVER eaten Ahi without chopsticks.  Sac-religious of sorts.  \n\nThis ended up being our dinner because it was so filling and satisfying.  Two of us ate fantastic food (to include quality Filet Mignon and Ahi) and we had 3 kick-butt drinks for under $35!!!!   That's a GREAT deal!!!\n\nIf it hadn't been for the fact that it was 110 degrees, we would have enjoyed the lovely outdoor area.  I hope that our travels bring us back here in the winter!!\n\nI posted a few pictures, but I need to apologize for the fuzziness of the Ahi pic...I was on my second Margarita by that time!  LOL",

My food took one hour and 25 minutes before it arrived. When my food arrived, the accompanying side dish wasn't even the one I ordered.\n\nThere seemed to be a complete absence of any managers or owners who were overseeing the place. Shame on the owner or manager because you would have noticed there was a problem if you were doing your job.  This is YOUR fault!  No one else's.  If you are the owner, sell the business to someone who cares. If you are the manager, I hope the owner tells you to seek employment elsewhere.\n\nThe few good things were that the food was excellent (and hot in spite of the delay).  Carl, whom I don't even think was our waiter, was very attentive when he realized on his own that there was a problem at our table. (We never complained, however). And our waitress was very sweet and very apologetic (although not very attentive during the course of the evening).",

The chicken parmagiana was a huge hit by our guests.  First item to run out. Penne san remo was popular as the ingredients were fresh and the dish was savory.  By far of of my favorite dishes at Buca. Vegetarians enjoyed the baked ziti. Salad fresh and crisp.  Combination of ingredients explode with the perfect balance.  Tiramisu ran out in 10 minutes once placed on the table.  Should have ordered more. Overall a great food experience and highly recommend catering services or simply just dine in to get a taste of great quality italian food.  Thank you!",

They were welcoming and gave off a Guam vibe. \n \nWe ordered the Hafa Adai plate and Beef plate then sat down. It took about 15-20 minutes to receive our food. First of all, they gave us the BBQ chicken plate instead of the Beef plate we ordered. Upon opening the box, we were hoping it to be fresh and hot because it took quite a bit of time to \"cook\" but it was just warm food. \n\nThe red rice overall was a pretty good recipe but I've had better. The texture and tenderness of the chicken kelaguen was good but I felt like they completely overpowered it with lemon, as if I was eating a lemon warhead. Comparing the two plates and the given the price, the portions of meat given was small. On top of that, the meat lacked flavor, was not tender and poorly marinated. The filling of the empanada seemed to be drenched in oil and greasy. The thing I did enjoy was the finadene, which added flavor to the main entree meat. \n\nOverall the service was something I did expect in Guam. A very genuinely nice ambiance. The owners as well as their employees were very kind and hospitable. It made me feel like I was back on the island!  \n\nIf they were able to focus just more on the flavor and taste of the food, they would have a very good restaurant. To sum it all up the food was okay, but the Guam vibe made up for the experience! The restaurant has a lot of potential and I'd be willing to give this place another chance.",

They were super busy so it wasn't an issue for us. The customer service was wonderful too. Make sure you come hungry because the portions are HUGE! =)",

    "text": "Came here on a rainy Friday night and left super satisfied!  I had read about this place already and being that it's from the same owner that brought us La Carnita where the wait for a table is sooooo long, we called ahead to ask how long we can expect to wait for a table of two.  They said 30 minutes which we thought was ok so we walked over.  When we got there, we were able to snag two seats at the bar immediately (we were starving) so was pretty happy with that!\n\nI'm always a bit wary of the pretentiousness of the joints in King West but Home of the Brave was refreshingly cool and low-key, not to mention quite reasonably priced considering its location and the quality of the food.  Our bartender/server was really friendly and she offered good recommendations for drinks and food.  Our food was served promptly and our glasses were always kept full.\n\nWe had the chicken handshake sandwich, fried bologna sandwich, lobster roll, and red velvet funnel cake (all shared, but a bit tricky to split the sandwiches which were generously stuffed).  All winners, but my favourite was the chicken handshake sandwich.  Having been pretty much raised on dim sum, the fried chicken foot didn't bother me one bit.  The fried bologna sandwich was delicious (not what you brought to school as a kid), with a generous serving of bologna on a soft eggy bun.  The lobster roll was also really tasty.  To be honest, we were full from our sandwiches, but the call of the red velvet funnel cake easily overcame my weak weak defense against dessert.  It was super tasty (though a bit too sweet for my tastes) and less greasy that what you'd find from a stand at Wonderland.  Came garnished with fresh berries which made me feel a tiny bit better about eating deep fried dough and sugar.\n\nWould definitely come back here again...the rest of the menu looks pretty interesting and if our first visit was any indication, it should be really good too!",

    "text": "Made reservations months ago for two suites for a bridal party. Confirmed all details three times leading up to the date. When the ladies were checked in they were shown to the wrong size suite.  That was soon corrected.  Was told making original reservations that they had to be paid for in advance because of special rate.  Upon check in my card would not go through so they charged the someone in the wedding party's card. They had to come find me to get the charges off and put on correct card.  I had my number stolen and credit card company closed that card and issued me a new one. I didn't think it mattered since they TOLD ME I WAS PAYING IN ADVANCE and I was under the impression it was done months before.  On the plus side, absolutely beautiful decor and very polite staff. \n    We also arranged for Rehearsal Dinner in their restaurant, La Plancha. This was in a lovely side alcove area with special table arrangement and menus.  Lynzee did an awesome job. The food was fantastic. The service was incredibly slow.  It was embarrassing. They were bound and determined to hold off dinner and appetizers until they could run up the open bar tab for several hundreds of dollars. They did apologize. It took maybe an hour for any food to hit the table.  I had to get up and ask them to clear away empty appetizer platters after they sat there.  There were no other customers in the restaurant all night. \n    After all the hotel charges had stopped pending, I found I was confused since it just stated \"lodging\" for each charge. I wanted to go over a more detailed bill so I called hoping to speak to a billing department since it was more than I estimated. I was told I could speak to the manager Shaun and he would help.  I left a voice mail, and it's been a few weeks.  He did not return my call. Disappointing experience.",

    "text": "Back in 2009 when Don and I were just dating, I kept telling him about a \"Cosplay Lounge\" that was opening up in Vegas. I never got around to going and soon forgot about it because it didn't gain much popularity (nothing even pops up when typed into Yelp). Forward almost three years later and Don was taking me on a \"surprise\" lunch date. He parked at Monte Carlo and I had no idea where we were going. I never even knew where the Cosplay Lounge was located, so that's totally not what I was expecting. We turned the corner and he said, \"This is it!\" and I was still confused, because it said \"Dragon Noodle Co.\" which didn't ring a bell at all. That's when said, \"It's the Cosplay Lounge!\"\n\nWe walked past the completely empty lounge area and into the restaurant where there were only two other people dining. The waiter brought out our menus and told us there were currently lunch specials and dim sum. I noticed Don looking around all disappointed and he told he he was confused because he expected to at least see someone dressed in costume, but not a single person was. When the waiter came back, Don asked him about the \"Cosplay Lounge\" and the waiter gave him this extremely puzzled look like he had no idea what he was talking about. So Don started describing it and talking about the costumes and the guy said, \"Ooooh, that's not all the time. It's just at night on weekends.\" By the way he answered, it sounded like he was even unsure of that. I have a feeling they don't even do the \"Cosplay\" thing anymore, but I could be wrong. \n\nAfter getting over the whole situation, we went ahead and ordered two lunch specials: Mongolian Beef ($9.95) and Orange Chicken ($9.95). Both came w/ soup, rice, and a Spring roll. On top of that we also ordered Salt & Pepper Calamari ($8.25) and Steamed Pork Siu Mei ($3.50). The Calamari was very different. It didn't come with any sauces and it came on a bed of lettuce with onions and jalapenos on top. We both really enjoyed it. Rather than relying on the sauce for the flavor, the dry toppings gave it all the flavor it needed and the jalapenos were a nice little kick. The Orange Chicken was alright, nicely breaded and cooked. The Mongolian Beef, however, was WAY TOO SAUCY. This pic I took: http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/deeOpEHwPHQpXvF7YYPIcA/l.jpg doesn't even detail the amount of sauce that was on it because the lighting was poor. It was like someone was having a water balloon fight in the kitchen, except with water balloons filled with sauce and one of them accidentally landed and exploded on top of my Mongolian Beef. I just stuck to everything else on my plate and picking off Don's plate. \n\nOverall, the two things I liked about this place were the ambiance and the Calamari. The service wasn't that great. The waiter only refilled our water once and that was when we asked him to do so when he brought out the bill. The only thing that would bring me back would be the Calamari and I'd probably order it to-go.",

No problem.\"  \n\nHe was very attentive, brought our drinks promptly, and even brought refills before our drinks were half empty. The food was served pretty quickly and was good. \n\nWhen the bill came, the 10% had not been taken off.  Another gentleman came to accept payment.   Therefore, I had to explain the.

Let me warn you... this kimchi is abnormally spicy for some reason... STILL AMAZING though. \n\nTopoki with choice of red sauce, seafood, and ramen: this sauce is pretty spicy compared to the ones you're used to in normal Korean restaurants. It definitely does not have that hint of sweetness you're so used to. If you can't handle spicy... i suggest you choose a different sauce because you will definitely feel it a couple bites in.",

The taco meats were dry and saturated with sugar (something I've noticed at other FF restaurants too), the tortillas were verging on stale, and the salsa bar, while always a good sign, contained exactly one edible salsa. \n\nTrying to stuff some calories in the ol' pie hole and get back to work, I doused my tacos in green Tabasco from the bottle on the table. \nProblem?

    "text": "18 days without air conditioning and 32 days without a properly working zone control. Do I honestly need to say anything else?  \n\nLike most people, the only reason I got mixed up with AZ Trademasters was because they were assigned to me via my home warranty (One Guard). The problem I encountered was that my AC was not blowing cool air, while also short cycling (turning on and off every few minutes). A technician came out rather quickly and determined that I needed a new zone control sensor. My issue wasn't covered under warranty, so I was quoted an out of pocket cost for the repair. Seeking reassurance, when I spoke to the owner, he confidently said that this part would fix my issue.\n\nGuess what? It didn't.\n\nI contacted them a second time. Another technician comes out, having absolutely zero back-story on the current situation. After filling him in, they determined that I now need a new zone control board. This also isn't covered under my warranty and will result in an even bigger out of pocket cost. But that's okay, as I was, once again, assured that this part would fix my issue.  \n\nGuess what? It didn't.\n\nAfter two failed attempts to fix my unit, the AC continued to not work, forcing me to contact them a third time. By now, we're passed the point of ridiculous. Unable to provide me with answers, they instead decided to \"research\" the issue with my manufacturer to see just exactly what could be going on. I'm sorry, but I don't have time to just sit around for several days waiting for repair people to \"research\" my issue.\n\nWhile all this was going on, I decided to seek out a second opinion. Within a matter of hours, someone came out and very quickly diagnosed the \"lack of cool air\" issue, which was the result of a bad TXV.  And guess what? It just so happens to be covered under my warranty. Oops! I guess the techs at AZ Tradmasters overlooked this?\n\nThey eventually did the repair, although the owner explained that I still needed additional work done on my zone control, pointing out that my unit was in need of a specific valve. I was supposed to receive a quote for the additional repair, which I requested multiple times. I never received it. Then again, after two failed fixes and such terrible communication, do you honestly think I'm going to let them do anything else to my unit?  \n\nI called my warranty company and demanded that they send out another company (Cool Blew). Guess what? The valve that they claimed that I needed was there all along! It was just well hidden and not properly set up. A few adjustments, a couple of thermostat modifications, and guess what? My AC and zone control system works. No new parts, no guess work, and no research needed. Thank goodness I didn't get duped for a third unnecessary repair.\n\nOverall, I had a very bad experience with these people. Communication was extremely poor.  The only one who has any idea of what's going on is the owner, and even his communication was on the shoddy side. I usually had to call my warranty company, who would then, in turn, call them for me - as they obviously need to remain on their good side.\n\nBecause this company was assigned to me, I had unresolved issues for over a month! If the right repair company was assigned to me in the beginning, my issues would have been resolved within a matter of days, not weeks!\n\nBottom line: If you're a One Guard Warranty customer and you have an issue, request that they send another company out to look at your AC. After my horrid experience, there's absolutely no way in hell I'd ever let these people near my AC ever again.   \n\nStay away!",

    "text": "This place reminds me of the Philippines...in a bad way.  I'd like to lead off with this disclosure: I love to visit the Philippines, it's a mostly gorgeous country, and the people are top notch. With that stated, my experience with businesses in the Philippines is pretty consistent: \"the customer is always wrong\".  This was also my experience at Pancit Adobo.\n\nI ordered the Arroz Caldo to try the breakfast dish.  For $4.99, you get a delicious soupy rice and chicken dish and coffee.  Well, that's what you are supposed to get.  Instead, I was given a different Arroz Caldo meal (about $6.25) and was charged an extra $1.00 for the instant coffee.  I decided to discuss the matter with the person at the cash register.  The discussion went nowhere.  I then used a visual aid...the restaurants advertised breakfast special that was hanging on the wall.  With my finger, I pointed at their advertisement.  I was told that even though the sign said \"$4.99 breakfast includes coffee\" and Arroz Caldo was the very first item listed, it was really the dishes that were under the Arroz Caldo that were for $4.99.  What???\n\nI liked the Arroz Caldo.  It was freshly cooked.  The coffee was fine.  Most of the dishes they offer are pre-cooked, out on display.  If you like your Filipino food fresh, this may not be the place for you.  If you like businesses that honor their own advertised prices, this may not be the place for you.  If you long for the experience of \"the customer is always wrong\"...you've struck gold here.",

    "text": "I had been urged to come here several times by friends, for whom this is their go-to place for a Mexican food fix.  Finally, they simply took me here.  I didn't know what to expect in a remote area of town that was previously unknown to me.  I just ordered my favorites, and let the chips fall where they landed.\n\nIn this case an abundance of warm tortilla chips freshly made in house landed on my table in a woven basket, along with hot sauce and a bean dip, just after I had sat down--on a super-hard, wooden seat.  The chips and dipping alternatives were welcome sights for this hungry diner.  Soon two orders of guacamole joined this array, and I quickly forgot about my hard seat.  \n\nThe homemade guacamole was cool and creamy, but it still retained a few small lumps and tiny pieces of tomato.  If it contained any sour cream, it was not enough for me to notice.  The hot sauce was good and tasty, with medium-level spiciness.  The bean dip, slightly salty, was mild and addictive.  The chip basket was emptying fast, as one after the other worked their way to my mouth.  Service was excellent, as my water and Sprite were replenished without request, and I was even asked to hand over used paper napkins during the course of dining, so new ones could be immediately supplied.  I don't know if this was the regular level of service or influenced by my photo and note taking inside the restaurant.  But it was stellar service.\n\nI ordered a Burrito Mojado, a wet carnitas burrito covered with Enchilada Sauce and a smattering of guacamole, that I suspected would be too large for me to finish in one sitting.  And I was right--especially because I ordered it with an a la carte Shredded Beef Taco.  The burrito, which was filled with carnitas, beans, and rice, was a bit salty but otherwise tasted great.  The Enchilada Sauce over melted cheese was mild, which is what I prefer.  I ate and enjoyed a little over half of the gigantic burrito that arrived before me, and packaged the remainder for a follow-up lunch.    \n\nThe taco in a springy, mostly hard corn tortilla, as ordered, tasted good, but I was quite disappointed that, although it contained adequate amounts of shredded beef, lettuce, and shredded cheese, this taco was sans tomato.  I often pay extra to make sure that I get tomatoes in my tacos, but this time decided that I would just eat what was presented to me as is.  I was surprised that the taco tasted as good as it did while lacking tomatoes, but still would have preferred some cool, red vegetation in that taco.  \n\nNon-Mexican fare did not fare that well on this outing.  Diane's ordered Cheeseburger ran into serious trouble.  In two tries at medium-rare, the kitchen first produced a patty that was beyond well done, and then another that was simply well done.  And the forlorn patties each looked to be no thicker than 1/8 of a pound.\n\nThe restaurant had a display case that contained a Chocolate Cake, Red Velvet Cake, Carrot Cake, Cheesecake, and Lemon Cake that all looked pretty good.  So, I ordered a slice of Lemon Cake for sharing.  And, it was cold, imbued with the flavor of lemon, and pretty darn good!\n\nCasa Don Juan has a nice, festive atmosphere with some interesting touches, like several pictures and photos of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo on a dedicated wall.  This is Old Las Vegas, South of the Border style.  And, based on what I ate and experienced here, I intend to return.",

You have a beautiful October day , a fun family that likes to exercise together, a mom and dad that love the AZ desert  so Pinnacle Peak is a great place to put it all together for our family. Welcome to our Weekend Hike. \n\nI love the feel of a different \"type\" of  mountain to climb.My husband and I usually climb  Thunderbird Mountains  or Camelback. This was different with a  gravel path  instead of a large rocky path. The  hike is also unique that it is a turnaround versus a point to point hike. \n\nWatch out for the variety of people .The path is narrow and some people are unaware of the need to move over for faster climbers.",

Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Potato, Toast, Pancake.\n\nBut then a quick breakfast pit stop became a LONG and drawn out morning with minimal and very poor service by ladies in a very bad mood. It was not even that early! Like, 9am! Come on! They were so bitchy and unfriendly and had the most sour looks ever! I know this is not Disney Land, but do you have to make it a bitchfest so early in the morning???\n\nPeople came into the cafe and then people who came in AFTER us started to get their food BEFORE us. It was not complicated food we had ordered. And Egg is and Egg really. You just crack it into a pan and watch it fry up and throw the hashbrowns onto the oil and whatever.\n\nThe bitchfest was contagious and we started to get bitchy and restless too, starting to join the mood of our servers. When the table that had the baby at it got their food at the same time as us - but had come in the restaurant an HOUR after us -- that was THE LAST STRAW.\n\nWe ate in bitchy silence fuming, having waited like 2 hours for a simple meal of Eggs. And the hashbrowns were tasteless and limp. Even I can make better hashbrowns than that.\n\nTo top it all off, the waitress LIED on the bill about what time we actually came in the restaurant, putting down a time, like, 45 minutes later.\n\nI exited to the casino (and got hit on by a disgusting drunk man) while my friend bitched it up to the manager. \n\nSo we got some discount. But we couldn't bring back all that extra time we wasted sitting in that blah place on the hard chairs in the middle (not even a booth), with growling stomachs and missing swimming pool time.\n\nAnother bridge burned in Vegas...",

So far I've used him for oil changes, tint, and a couple of new tires.\n\nThis isn't a big chain or anything like that. Wassek is the guy who runs it, and he seems to really care about his customers, and understand the importance of good service and knowing what's going on. He offers a variety of services, like I said, so I think you could pretty much bring your car here for whatever you want - routine stuff, or fancier things.\n\nThe most important thing I look for in a mechanic is somebody who I don't think is going to try and screw me, and while that's not always an easy thing to determine, Wassek is always to-the-point, and seems like an honest fellow. He could have tried to sell me 4 tires when I needed 2 new ones, and he didn't. He's never tried to upsell me on anything. I appreciate that - just keep me on the road, man, you know?\n\nThe second most important thing to me is communication - specifically around timelines. Some mechanics will be like, \"Hey I'll call you when it's ready\" which is a load of crap. Wassek said my oil change would be fast, and I was in and out of there in like, 15 minutes. Nice. He said he'd order the tires, and have them installed by like, 1 or something, and he gave me a call before 1 and let me know it was done and to come pick them up. Stuff like that makes it so I can keep living my life while my car is being worked on and I don't have to put everything on hold while I wait.\n\nThe waiting area is nice and clean and cool, and he's got wifi, and a camera setup so you can kind of watch them while they work on the cars. This place is also near a bunch of stores, so if you wanted to walk across the street to McDonalds or some fancy hippy cafe while you wait, that'd be easy.\n\nI'll be going back.",

The two rooms that were in the \"old tower\" were entirely unacceptable. They were not only old and tired but filthy and in total disrepair. One room even had a bloody hand print on the wall! Dirty linens, stained carpets, marred furniture, stained bathroom amenities, the list is long. We went to the front desk to see about changing a room and were told they were totally sold out so no other rooms available. Then, when I offered a tip, the nice young lady said, \"well I can probably find one but it will be an extra $75 per night\". When I told her that was ridiculous, considering they were already paying $250 per night, she kindly reduced the upgrade fee to $40 per night. How funny that she miraculously found a room! Extortion just like the old Mob days!\n\nWe had our choice of two free rooms at any Caesar's property and chose Bally's only because it was less expensive for those who had to pay. We will never make that mistake again. You could not pay me to stay there again.\n\nThe gambling was the worst I've experienced in my 30 years of experience. I don't expect to get rich but a simple return once in a while would have been reasonable. I didn't believe the horrible gambler reviews online about this place buy now I understand and agree.\n\nThe only decent thing about this hotel is its location. However, there are so many better choices in the area and price range. One bright spot - A couple of the staff members were very nice, particularly the lady at the Diamond Desk.\n\nDo yourself a favor... choose somewhere else! We couldn't have been more disappointed.",

The close quarters of the former garage make for easy conversation with strangers, now new acquaintances about politics, Ev Mecham or even your most recent Yelp review.\n\nTake advantage of the drive-thru, Starbucks-style as you drive past the antique gas pumps out front. All told, it's a great stop, and you can support another wonderful local business.\n\nFour stars 'cause they close at 9pm (as of the writing of this review). I wanna hang out Tempe-Coffee-Plantation style like in my ASU days.\n\nThanks, Bill.",

After driving there, their sign was still up but no signage to indicate where to go in the building (it was a strange multi-story building).

Turns out they closed that location - but she didn't tell me that. Then I make it in the their building on Camelback and the woman at the front counter couldn't even bother to look up let alone say a greeting.\n\nHowever, to the credit of Victoria (another employee), she was very helpful once she noticed that I was waiting.

Pulling up, you wouldn't expect it to be as massive as it is, but first impressions mean nothing before you step through its gates.\n\nRobinson Ranch is owned and operated by Mr. Robinson, who teaches riding classes, hosts therapy sessions, and hosts riding clubs that partake in activities from parades, funerals, and I'm also pretty positive civil war reenactments. \n\nThe ranch is large and they have over 20 horses (several who were loaned/borrowed out at the time I visited). They also had pigs, sheep (I saw 3 that were born the same day, so cute!), and other animals you'd expect to find on a farm. Each type of animal had a clean enclosure with plenty of food and water and a great amount of space. People who treat animals properly are the people you want to support.\n\nMr. Robinson has a gang of volunteers that help in every aspect of the ranch and he is always looking for more. If I lived in the area I would definitely sign up. He screens every applicant and has every volunteer do orientation.\n\nI cannot say enough wonderful things about this ranch. You should look them up if you're in the area and want to take a riding class or join a riding club.",

My husband ordered the pork chop, and I got the mushroom risotto. Both meals were plated beautifully and absolutely delicious.

I don't know if I've ever had such a tough time choosing an entree at a restaurant. I ended up deciding on the Chicken and waffles, since I have yet to try this popular dish at any restaurant up to now, and it was exceptional. The fresh fruit, mango edamame, and ginger syrup was an amazing combination with the fried chicken - an awesome balance of sweet and savory. The breading on the chicken though also had a bit of a sweetness too, and was very good. \n\nThe staff were very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is very cool - would go back again and again, and would recommend to anyone.\n\nOne tip, that I will also share below - make a reservation! This place is hopping, monday through sunday, and twice before coming today I tried to walk in and found them completely full and booked up.

Importantly for that price there was a very reasonable amount of tuna and salmon...I hate it when other places skimp on the star protein of the bowl. \n\nThe combo of flavors was delicious and very filling. The fake crab slaw was yummy and the fried onions added a delicious crunch. Avocado always a winner with salmon and tuna. I substituted brown rice and had the wasabi mayo both were great. Little disappointed they didn't have the macadamia nuts on the menu which I was willing to pay extra for. \n\nGuy who made my bowl just stared at me no hi or what would you like. Girl he handed it over to was pretty grim too - didn't ask if I wanted any garnishes and just said very matter-of-fact \"no macadamia nuts\". Cashier was much better. Saying that I'm here just for takeout at lunch so don't really expect 5 star service. I'd come back and try some of the other bowls as long as they don't start cheapening out on the fish portions.",

Looks like it has been recently seeded and allowed to get established so I'm guessing it was closed for a while.  \n\nSo this park has plenty of running room for the dogs, a nice aggregate walking path for owners, water source for dogs and generally many other dogs to chum up with yours.  There are several permanent benches for seating and a covered shade structure.  Plenty of trash cans to pick up after your dog with poo bags available or scooping tools.  I just wish more people picked up after their dog or assume they did and pick up a pile you see to make up for missing your own dogs.  As the poo situation was way better than past visits, I still walked continuously for 10 minutes scooping pile after pile.  \n\nBathroom facilities are located within a couple hundred feet from dog park in between the sports fields.  Parking is convenient and if you have kids playing a sport at sports fields, bring your pooch along and let them enjoy the dog park.  The entire facility is nice and usually great fellow dog lovers and owners.",

The server seemed to be overwhelmed with his 4 tables. The table next to ours was complaining as well with more complaints than I can imagine. I've been in the service industry and still am for 22 years. Never  have recieved my salad after my meal and have never had cold crab legs. Saw on my bill the crab legs  were taken off as I requested  (with no apology or replacement by my server) just an \"uh...ok..and off he went. Never seen a server so frazzled with 4 tables, maybe a bad day? Don't know. His attitude was the same with each table he dealt with that I observed. On my bill the reason given for  the crab legs taken off were \"customer didn't like\" Are you freaking kidding me??? My favorite food of all time, just don't like them cold! Weird? And I still tipped that jerk $20 & it Would've been  $40 to $50 per my norm if the service was good, but it was horrible. Something I also noticed,  no manager responds to any of these yelp reviews, so in short, Black Angus doesn't really  give a shit about our experience or opinion.  Btw, manager took out drink order, brought our drinks, then we saw our server. Never saw manager again unail she told my husband to have a good night when we were leaving! Hahaha!",

The bar occupys up to about 40 guests with well informed servers presenting your food to the guest over the counter.  It becomes obvious that you are at a Robuchon's vision of being a japanese  style counter chef.  But with Robuchon's stern eye in the room,  his food is complete in all forms but none.\n\nThe crispy thin tart of sweet onion and pancetta was offered with a couple of perfectly cooked quail eggs that burst with the mellow yellow yolk.  It was so delicious and it was garnished with a nice pairing of sorrel greens.  He had the fancy stuff too.  Such as the quail egg stuffed with foie gras and served with truffle potatoe puree.  Man it was good.  Very small and expensive... but it was worth it.  I think.\nOne dish stood out above the rest and that was the steak tar tar... Basically a raw burger patty with the fixings ... dijon. onions. pickles.  s&p... Served with french fries and a tiny little wedge of iceburg lettuce, I really began to think I was eating a burger and fries.  \n\nThe presentation is very precise and the line cooks take there time to get things right on the plates.  They move fast but take their time on the plates.  A sign of a good experience to come.  \n\nBut it just so happened that he was there that weekend and I got to meet the icon... practically a god to most people.  He is the inventor of new cusine almost.  But more then all of that, he is just a great chef.  I found he was a very nice man and up next  is hopefully the Mansion next door.  When I asked him how it was... he just smiled looked at me and nodded his head up and down with a silly little smile on his face and I trusted his every nod.",

For entree, we got the Blacken Chilean Steelbass and the House Special Cedar Smoked Salmon.  Biting into the blackened steelbass was, well, fun, but the taste isnt' anything revolutionary and it was a bit dry.  The Salmon had potential for innovative dish, but it was overly sweet and vinegary, which gave it a generic cast.For dessert, we got the mini creme brulee, a highlight of the meal. It had a particularly rich creamy body with a thin layer of caramel. The whip cream that came with it was outstanding and not merely decorative. \n\nFor a seafood place, the price was very reasonable.",

It's a good thing they have a call button, because even with the call button we had a difficult time getting the attention of a server.  Sub-par service aside, the sushi really speaks for itself.  \nWe ordered a medium combination platter (83 pieces of sushi, maki & sashimi) - this platter was ~$90.  The quality of the fish here is really awesome - good substantial size, fresh and sweet.  There's also a really good variety of different fish in the platter.

We had such a wonderful time the other day during our round of golf at The Phoenician Golf Course. \nI will also mention that it topped out around 112 degrees that day as well, so keeping me happy all day wasn't an easy task.\n\nThe summer rate is awesome, via Golfnow.com we got a tee time at 11:36 a.m. for only $35 (including tax) per person. It also included a cart and as many range balls as we could handle. \n\nOnce we arrived I quickly remembered we were at one of the nicest resorts in Arizona. People around to help with anything and everything. \nWhen we got there the guy outside got our cart ready to go while we checked in with the shop inside. When we came back the clubs were set, he had loaded the ice chest with water (complementary) and ice, made sure we had everything we needed and sent us on our way. Not before letting us know that we could take our time at the range, as there weren't many people out today so we could tee off pretty much whenever we wanted. \n\nWe hit a few balls then to the first tee we went. I didn't play any of the holes, I was the birthday boys caddy for the day. So basically I sat in the cart, in the shade, looked pretty and pulled the pin every now and then. They had no issue with me just riding along, and I didn't have to pay. So awesome! \n\nThe course is beautiful! Looks just as immaculate as I'm sure it does during the cooler months. The views were amazing too! We played too 9 hole courses, Oasis and Canyon. Both awesome. Oasis has a lot of water around it and really lush and green. Canyon was further up the mountain a bit, great too look out on the city. \n\nThe drink/snack cart chica came around several times, loaded us up withmore ice and water. We were very thankful for that!\n\nWhen we were finished, the golf dude washed his clubs and kept an eye on them while we went in to grab a cocktail at the bar. \n\nThank you Phoenician! We will be back! maybe not when it's $250 a round, but we will be back.",

Easy to spot in the corner- large sigh and patio. You can smell the sweetness from a block a way. Chocolatiers have not only mastered the sweet they have also done well with savory. This was the first stop of Montreal for my friend ( her first time in Montreal) and they didn't disappoint. We ordered brunch: I the spinach /buckwheat crepe with sunny side egg and my friend the Turkey. Be aware they do have gluten free options but their crepes are made with Buckwheat. We each tried some form of chocolate latte and then after some time of easy chatter and digestion we shared the Tiramisu. Best brunch experience ever! Can definitely purchased goods to go as they have great fondue sets. St Laurent location was large and I have been to St Denis location- small but quaint - still the same yummy smell and ambience of each!",

I have always sat in the balcony area because I am a teacher and we know how much they get paid, but I am always able to see what is going on and I still have a great time. \n    The last show I saw was Mamma Mia and it was amazing! The acoustics are fantastic, and being a band teacher, it sticks out. I am always pleasantly surprised that I can hear all of the actors clearly and be able to hear the orchestra accompany the songs.\n    The reason I gave it four stars, is because of the bathroom fiasco. There are several bathrooms but whoever installed them,was definitely not a woman because there were only 2 stalls for 2 levels of seating for women. I have hit the bathrooms at the right time and the wrong time. The wrong time was standing in line for the entire intermission only to finish as the lights were cueing us to go back to our seats. Of course, you forget about the inconvenience when the show starts back up again. \n     I am looking forward to going back to see another wonderful show soon!",

They put you in a room where they just say watch this video where people just walked out to the track just to ignore it. Nobody makes sure you watch the video, just leave you in a room that you can easily walk out. On the track, there was just one guy, not caring at all that was happening on the track not knowing what he was supposed to do. Flags weren't used when trying to pass, he walked off at times mid-race more focused on a girl.  He used the YELLOW flag which means CAUTION to end the race instead of the CHECKERED. My sister spun out and I passed her 4 laps before he came back and realized she was out of the race. Did I mention the Go-Karts were horrible? This is my 5th go-kart place and by far the worst I've been to. If you have kart experience, DO NOT come here!",

    "text": "My husband and I went here for our anniversary and had a great experience. It was a little pricey but the food and service were worth it. I think this is by far the best \"special occasion\" restaurant in the Phoenix area. Not as snobby as some of the places in Scottsdale resorts and far better food than Compass downtown. \n\nWe started off at the bar since our table wasn't ready when we arrived. They have a variety of specialty martinis. The \"Great Fruit\" was a good sweet and fruity cocktail and the candied grapefruit slice made it special. I ordered the \"SKOCU THU\" which had a bit of spice to it and was garnished with a dried chili. It sounds weird but it was amazingly good! Definitely one of the best cocktails I have ever had. The bartender also made a smaller sized Mesquite Bean Martini for us to sample which had excellent flavor but I think you have to like Bourbon to truly enjoy it. \n\nAs for the food, the menu is a little different and requires an adventurous palate. I enjoyed the Native American influence and focus on local food. We ordered an appetizer that had cured ham, raw fish, and buffalo tartare, which worked well since it had a variety of items to try and was a good for sharing. There was a small soup included in the meal (just a taster size) and also sorbet to cleanse the palate between courses. My husband ordered the Buffalo as his entree which was a good size and he said it had excellent flavor. I had the Seafood Potpourri which was also excellent though I am not sure how that fits in with their Southwest theme. The only criticism of the menu that I have is that the only poultry item was duck. So, if you are not a game meat or seafood person you would be out of luck. I did appreciate the fact that they had a good selection of half-bottles and wine by the glass because after the martinis we could not have handled a full bottle of wine. Since it was our anniversary they gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse for dessert and so that was a nice surprise but I think otherwise they still provide truffles as a finish.\n\nI highly recommend Kai as a place you must try at least once, but be prepared to spend some money.",

Its in the far southwest corner at Dana Park, is hidden, and is worthy of your seafood cravings!  \n\nNo more Red Lobster, people, give this place a go, and it is all sorts of family good, big tables, excellent food, good drinks.  Give to the locals, not to the chains.  They also have seafood for purchase, and its fresh as AZ can get it, and the prices are good.  I love the Salt Cellar, but they have since raised their rates through the roof, we looked for less pricey, and they serve up just as amazing food.  Its quaint as well, reminding you that you are in a local seafood joint, and takes you as if you were just off the beach, whether west coast or east coast.  We have the east coasters to prove it!",

    "text": "I had been itching to try this place out for so long because I worked with a fellow who was from Miami and raved about Cuban food (which was back in December). And word of mouth is Havana Grill is the place to get your Cuban food fix. Although I was a skeptical to try this place because of Teri C.'s review and the other reviews as well, I had to try them out for myself. \n\nFortunately we came in during happy hour, which was half prized appetizers. We ordered the Mezcla de Aperitivos (consisted of tamal, papa rellenas, croquetas, and cuban sandwich) and Mini Sandwich Cubano. \n\nTamal- I didn't like their tamal at all. More dry than usual and no taste either. \n\ncroquetas- we weren't sure what these were because there wasn't a description on the bar menu. Unfortunately, as soon as I took a bite I spat it back out into my napkin. Maybe this was a little too authentic for me. \n\nMini Cuban Sandwich- the bread was nicely buttered and the contrast between the mustard and pickles was a unique mix. The ham could had been a little tastier, but good enough. I was really expecting more based on how much people rave about Cuban sandwiches. I'm really hoping other Cuban places make a better one because theirs was just A-okay. \n\nThere was no papa rellenas at the time was I was kind of sad because they serve those at Porto's Bakery. I also ordered the guava shake, although I'm not a big guava fan I was trying to be adventurous. I didn't really enjoy this drink because there was nothing special about it and I prefer my shakes on the thick side and itwas rather thin. \n\nOverall, the experience was okay. The service was a tad slow and the food didn't really impress me. The inside is nicely decorated and still gives off the mom and pop vibe. However, I don't think I will be coming here again.",

    "text": "Since Mother's Day is a special occasion and District was having a special event, we decided that now was as good a time as ever to try this place.  I am so glad that we did.  While I balked at how much we spent, I can't help but remember how good everything was, and that it is definitely worth it.\n\nWe brought my other mom, mother-in-law, because she has a special appreciation for all things downtown and she had been wanting to try this place as well.  This place really is beautiful.  There is a modern edge to everything, but it's styled in a way that makes you feel incredibly comfortable here.  The staff is all unbelievably nice and friendly.  We were greeted with \"Happy Mother's Day\" all the way outside by the valet attendants to the inside by our server.  Not one staff member walked by without saying it.  That's a nice touch.\n\nNow the food.  WOW!  The buffet line was beautifully set up and was filled to the brim with excellent food.  I sampled, and then some, so much food that I thought I would burst.  I'm going to present this in list form because it's just easier that way.\n-French Toast Casserole: Sweet and tasty.  Like bread pudding in pecan roll form.\n-Scrambled Eggs - Light and fluffy and well seasoned.\n-Yogurt Parfait - Served in a martini glass with seriously good granola.\n-Bacon - Very good and cooked well.\n-Sausage - From Schreiners, very good but a tad to spicy for breakfast (at least for me)\n-Biscuits & Gravy - Different.  It wasn't very sausagey but I really enjoyed the taste of it.  It was not as heavy as normal B&G.\n-Fresh Fruit - The berries were served in shot glasses and were so perfect I couldn't believe it.  \n-Mac&Cheese - Definitely not my style, it was really boring to me, I would actually be upset if I ordered it.\n-Chocolate Mousse Cake - INCREDIBLE.  I wish I wasn't so stuffed at this point of my meal to actually enjoy it more.  The cake was super moist and dense, but the mousse inside was amazing.  I could eat a whole bowl of that stuff.\n\nI couldn't have been more pleased with this place.  Everything was delicious and beautiful.  I felt strangely at ease here.  It seems to be a fancy place, but it wasn't pretentious like I had expected.  We had such a wonderful time, and our server Jeff was fantastic.  One thing I was so amused with was every time an employee saw a napkin unfolded, they would twist it around and make it look nice again.\n\nBottom line, I would love to come here again, but I will have to wait till Payday.",

You can definitely taste the difference between a Dudt's donut and the chain competition. I tried to eat a Dunkin donut recently at a work event and literally couldn't finish it.\n\nBecause of my positive experience with the product, I was expecting an equally positive experience when I stopped by the shop last week for my husband's birthday. I wanted to pick up a half dozen of cookies to take home to him for his special day. \n\nThough the cookies that I purchased were very tasty, my experience was just...awkward. There were four women working, but none of them acknowledged my presence when I entered the (very small) shop. One of the ladies was blocking most of the counter (standing on the customer side) and it took her some time to realize that I couldn't see what to order due to her standing in the way. As I was leaving, she proceeded to block me from exiting as she picked up some sort of... bug, I think? from the ground inside the shop and placed it not far from the entrance outside.\n\nMy whole in-store experience was just strange and I look forward to returning to eating the treats that my coworkers provide, not picking them up myself.",

He has done a great job of easing my worries and saving my teeth. His cleanings are great, no hygienist rather the actual dentist. When I've needed fillings there are no issues, he always makes certain they don't rub or feel awkward. I read people questioning his tactics with the cavity detector but honestly wouldn't you rather have every piece of technology examine your teeth, early warning detection is a blessing. And as far as insurance is concerned, after being with Dr. Sciulli for so long, the office is amazing at working to get your insurance to cover the procedures (and I should know, after all these years I have had three different dental insurances). Dr. Sciulli's dental practice is truly a little gem in south Oakland and I recommend anyone looking for a GREAT dentist to seek him out you will not be disappointed.",

Flavours were good but I did find it greasy. If you are super picky about food contamination/cleanliness, I would avoid this place as the chef uses the same spatula for raw meat as he does for everything else including fried rice and veggies. That being said, it was a great show: he entertained us by setting the grill on fire and doing tricks with the cooking utensils!

When we got to the room, we were disappointed to see how \"big\" the room was...which it was not that big at all being a suite & all.. It seemed like a regular hotel room. \nThe air conditioner sucked ass.. we had blasted at 60 and we were still fanning ourselves and that was after we had complained and they had someone \"fix it\" by replacing the filter.. I guess you cant expect too much since the RIO is one of the oldest hotels in vegas...\nThe towel hangers came off... yea..surprise surprise..\n\nthe bed sheets had nasty brown spots..\n\nthe refrigerator felt like a cooler would have been a better and cooler option. \n\nLastly the pull out bed looked like it has been \"pulled\" all over the place.. the mattress was completely falling apart... it was sad for my friend who had to put up with it for one night and he even hurt himself trying to pull that disgusting old thing out of the couch. \n\n\nWhen I complained the next day all they could do was \"send someone out for repairs\"... I really was not trying to upgrade to a bigger room just a room that is not terrible... even if it is the same kind just a different room. ..and I asked the lady how long it would take because obviously this is an inconvenience for us.. she stared at me with a nasty look and replied, \"well you can stay int he room!\"..-- wow what an awesome customer service you just gave me you incompetent worthless customer service representative... I mean really I just want to be comfortable and do you really expect that we can sleep and feel like we have some privacy with 3 men walking around the room and fixing things and moving the couch out and putting in a new one? really? really? okay yeah sure I would love to stay in the room and awkwardly try to ignore the three men trying to \"fix things\". \n\n\nthe casino sucked as well.. its all OLD people. like old people that smell.\n\nthey offer a shuttle every 30 mins but its too bad its only good until 1 am so if you are out partying late then you either walk you ass home or pay for a cab(about $15).\n\n\noverall our experience here was terrible. \n\nI recommend that you DO NOT plan on getting a room here.\nGet the 24 hour buffet deal if you dont want to spend a lot on food.. buy it around 7 pm and you will be covered until 7 pm the next day.. so that covers your dinner, breakfast, lunch, and dinner again. Just don't stuff you face just because its a \"buffet\". We took advantage and ate at the Rio, Planet Hollywood, and almost at the Paris for crepes but we made it too late.\n\nI also recommend bringing your own blankets.. the brown one that they give you is gross and feels like its made out of foam.. its not comfortable or soft. \n\n\ndon't bother looking into this hotel.",

The decor was pretty cool with a rustic chic feel though at the expense of comfort as I was stuck between two different levelled wood tables. \n\nThe staff were extremely limited with one poor girl supplemented by a few busboys serving the entire restaurant of over 40 guests, so predictably the service was extremely slow and incorrect. I waited 30 minutes for my spiked coffee and only when prompted did the waitress acknowledge that she had forgotten and would get on it, she had to be additionally prompted that I needed to choose what to spike it with! Her knowledge of the menu was extremely lacking, and her ability to take English orders was also limited as she seemed to understand slightly better when I switched to French.\n\nThe food was nothing to write home about and with the substandard service and wait time this place falls short of the mark. If you're looking for a brunch place in the area I would rather go to Toi, moi et caf??.",

After having had enough of Starbucks' bitter tasting, overpriced coffee, I wanted a new local spot that could make a mean iced latte I so frequently crave. This place is it! Not only do they have amazing tasting coffee drinks and foobut their prices are great as well! It has a cute home-y vibe inside, and a great dog-friendly patio out back near the lake. The location is fantastic - right in McCormick Ranch and situated right on Lake Marguerite with a fantastic view of Camelback. I love getting my coffee to go and taking it for a walk around the lake. Oh, and do yourself a favor: order an Iced Caramel Macchiato (or Iced Caramel Latte, as they refer to it). You won't be disappointed!",

If you do need something, you have to work hard to catch their attention or get up and go after them to ask for what you need. Last time my shrimp tempura roll was cold and when I complained I was told that some people prefer it that way in the summer since its too hot outside. Really? I don't think so! Fresh, hot and crispy is expected from any kind of tempura.

I ordered the gyros sandwich, which came with salad and humus. I did not expect them to put both the salad and humus ON the sandwich.

None of the salsas are \"hot\".  Not even the \"extra hot\" one.  They need to rename those, or actually make them at least a little bit hot.\n2.  The chips & salsa ratio is seriously way off.  Few chips with a rather large salsa portion. \n3.  The miniature salsa portion with the burritos is a joke, especially since chips do not come with the burrito like they do at some alternative places like Rubios and such.  Even if someone wanted to dip their burrito into the miniature cup, it is too small, and the portion is too small to be of much use for gently adding it to one's burrito as it is eaten.\n4.  Adding onto #3 above, why not just add chips to the burrito order so the salsa isn't so lonely, or take away the salsa and drop the prices by 20 cents or so?",

The waitress ushered him in and found him a seat next to me.\n\nWe ordered the beef pho and a chicken with Vietnamese noodle dish.  Both were perfectly seasoned and very flavorful.  The broth just seemed to be completely saturated with flavor.  I have noticed that some Vietnamese restaurants will put in too much salt in order to compensate the flavor of their soup.  That's not the case here, there's just enough seasoning to bring out the real essence of the broth.  Also, the beef was just rare enough to be soft and also add to the delicacy.\n\nThe waiters were also prompt with refilling water and packaging our food once we finished.  Even though Vietnamese cuisine isn't very complicated, it does take a bit of mastery to get done right.  This place is definitely on the top of our favorites.\n\n-polite staff\n-perfect pho\n-would come again",

    "text": "They are the most shady rv rental in Las Vegas. I went in to location to get a quote for the\"ONLY\" RV in the showroom. They quoted me fo a much smaller unit letting me think I was getting the one in the showroom. I didn't find out this until I looked at floor plan of unit I reserved. I contacted the location and spoke with Sandra. She said she would speak with manager \" Judy Gonzales\" and someone would contact me in the morning. No one contacted me in the morning. So I went back to the location and spoke with Judy Gonzales. Which I must say in my opinion, has the poorest management skills I ever seen. I explained the situation to her and she came at me like I did something wrong . She said there was nothing she could do. Didn't try to come up with any solution to THEIR MISTAKE. You'd think for someone who was about to spend over $5000.00 , they would try to retain my business. I guess that's why they only have 2 stars on yelp. Don't waste your time or money with this company.\nSincerely, \nJason A.",

Our food was totally flavorless and a horrible value. I ordered the \"Hammered Hog\" sandwich, which touted a 1/2 pound of our house smoked pulled pork covered with blue cheese cole slaw. My wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich which stated it had a 1/3 pound of pulled pork on it. I swear, their was more meat on hers and mine was a buck more. Not that I would have wanted more meat, it had no flavor except smoke which I'm guessing was liquid smoke. The collard greens side I ordered was so acidic and lacking the long cooking time that this dish needs. I think they might have tasted sour because they had gone bad? My in-laws split a two meat combo and I was embarrassed to take them there. A $70.00 tab for two sandwiches, a split entree plate, one mixed drink and three sodas? Oh, and we ordered a plate of happy hour nachos which were store bought round corn tortilla chips, congealed cheddar cheese, maybe a cup of diced tomatoes and black olives with lackluster sour cream and salsa on the side. Needless to say, we will never go back. I give this place 6 months tops. Whoever thinks this qualifies as good BBQ needs to go to read a recipe and attempt to cook BBQ for the first time ever.

    "text": "So, my fam moved from NYC to Arizona a few years ago, and I'm sad to admit that I may be a bit of a snob when it comes to deli sandwiches (at one time I worked minutes away from Katz deli). I can't eat a lot of meat, so when I choose to, I want it to be good. That's not too much to ask, is it? I'm also not a fan of dishing out $10 for a sandwich that has mass distributed deli meats and cheeses (yes, boar's head, I'm looking at you). After 4 years in AZ I've pretty much given up on finding a good deli spot.\n\nSo then... I come across a positive review from a friend and my curiosity rises... And I go with my kids and MIL to check it out.\n\nOn that first visit we ordered an N.Y.T. Cubano, a White BBQ pork, a kids Mac-n-cheese... Oh wait - then my 3 yr old decides he wants eggs... Really, kid? The staff, however, didn't seem phased... Everyone was super nice and accommodating. They modified his meal and gave him an egg salad sandwich. Everything was so good. The white BBQ pork is seriously the best meat sandwich I've ever had. But the Cubano was excellent also (not overpowering salty but superbly flavored). When the kids Mac first came out, I was surprised to see a very small bowl. But do not be misled by the small bowl, my fellow yelpers! When I dumped her Mac on a flat plate to cook it off, it filled up the whole plate and was way more Mac than I expected. Btw - it is delicious.\n\nWe came back a few days later with a larger crew (there were 10 of us this time), so we were able to sample a wider selection of their menu. Hubby & I got a White BBQ pork (because I've been craving it since that first visit) and a pastrami sandwich and split both half and half. We also brought our 23 months old this time and we felt like he wasn't going to eat a full meal's worth. So we got 2 Macs, and our 5 y.o., 3 y.o. & 23 mos old split it in 3. Again, no problem, the staff brought out 3 plates and there was still plenty of food. The other 2 options that were ordered that time were the Caprese sandwich & the meatball sub. I seriously don't like meatballs, so i haven't tried it personally but both people at our table who got it - loved it. It also happens to be greeter Sam's favorite sandwich. The caprese sandwich looked great and I might want to try it the next time I'm there.\n\nAnd if that's not clear - all meats are made IN HOUSE!!!\n\nTotally worth checking out.",

    "text": "I went to this office for 4 years and every year questioned why I kept going back, but it seemed like more of an inconvenience to find a new doctor, but this year was the last straw. First of all, the reception staff is extremely nice and helpful, but the doctor is so rude and lacks people skills. \n\nEvery year I refuse to order contacts through them because they're at a high markup (typically 80-100%) from what you pay online. They claim to offer price matching but then don't when they see how low the prices are. They always try to pick a fight about it instead of acknowledging that the prices are lower and it's now a competitive market place since contracts can be sold online. \n\nThis past visit, during my annual exam, the doctor didn't do anything differently and charged my medical insurance because she prescribed me eye drops that I didn't even know I was getting prescribed until she asked where I wanted my prescription sent. I then got my EOB from my health insurance and called the office immediately and they said that I would not be getting a bill. Magically, a billed showed up yesterday and they basically told me that it was unfortunate that the doctor never told me she was doing a medical exam and that my medical insurance would be charged, but that I would still have to pay. I will never be going back to this office and can't wait to go to new eye doctor next year.",

I remember the food being good for the most part. The alligator was tender and juicy and the crawfish spinach artichoke dip was so so good. The Tomohawk steak was so amazing and came on a giant bone they let you take home for your dog if you want. The only complaint the first time was the Beignets I ordered for dessert. Im from New Orleans and Beignets are supposed to be fluffy and sweet and a bit crispy and covered with powdered sugar or honey. These were disgusting and hard and falling apart and tasted like gross old overused oil. They were barely dusted with powdered sugar and such a dissapointment. \n\nThe second time I went was Oct 2014 with my boyfriend. I bought a groupon so I thought that would be worth it since their prices are a little bit on the higher side. We had a few of their specialty drinks which were good and had a great amount of alcohol. Then we ordered Gumbo and the Ahi tuna tartare (?) for appetizers. The gumbo was below average. It didnt have very good flavor and wasnt even very warm. The tuna was even worse. It was cut kind of sloppy and jsut drenched in whatever sauce they use on it. For entrees my boyfriend got Jambalaya and I got a catfish and shrimp dish. The Jambalaya was also under-seasoned with a small amount of shrimp which was added for an additional charge. The dish I had with the shrimp was actually tasty but just too small of portions for what I paid (I think about $22). \n\nOverall, I would probably return again but only if I had a Groupon and only for the crawfish dip or tomohawk steak.",

It's actually pretty good, but today's experience was just not on par with the past. \n\nBiggest, almost inexplicable change - NO MORE WAFFLE FRIES!! I cannot understand this. They are just no longer on the menu. These were like angel tears in the form of fries and the reviewers raved about them so I just didn't get it.

Those waffle fries were SO DAMN GOOD! Total bummer. Also the kid today didn't offer us the little scoop on top of the ice cream as usual. \n\nThe fries were still pretty good, but I was really unimpressed when compared to my previous experiences. What a disappointment. I can see myself going back but no more going out of my way. :(",

They know more practice the art of making a quality product, the evidence to that is a machine that lays out the rice for them so I can slap a piece of cheap nori on it and turned into a very substandard role.\n\nYou might think I'm being somewhat of a snob or a total dick to this place, but after having worked for three years in high end Japanese cuisine and seeing what is possible and also eaten at several other aw IC e.

In fact, I've experienced the opposite: what I order is what I get and the staff is friendly and efficient. I've been especially impressed by the manager on duty on weekday mornings - he seems to keep things moving and pitches in wherever he's needed. \n\nI experienced a great example of this attentiveness a few weeks ago when I made a commitment to bring coffee into an 8am meeting but stupidly only left myself 15 minutes to stop and get it. I first went into Starbucks next door and was told it would take at least 15 minutes to get a carafe filled. I quickly ran next door to Einstein's to see if I would have better luck, and to my great relief, the on-duty manager saw that I was in a hurry and told me he'd \"get it done.\" About 6-7 minutes later, after true hustling, he gave me the full carafe and all of the cups, creamers, etc. \n\nAnyway, it's possible management has changed since a lot of these reviews because my experiences have really been pretty positive. \n\nP.S. Try the asparagus egg breakfast sandwich on the thin wheat bagel. It's a great vegetarian option. Just ask for light sauce.",

My friends enjoyed my behavior and thanks to them I arrived safely at home that afternoon. What I do like about Mayo is the consistency and promptness. For this particular appointment I checked in, they made copies of my medical power of attorney and living will. Yes, they actually stated to bring it if I had one. Thank goodness I took care of that back in 2001!!! I had the same nurse the entire time, that way you do form a bond and there is a level of trust. Again, as in the initial visit, when I entered the room the Dr., although a different one, was waiting for me. He discussed everything in great detail. They took a all quiet, the Dr. reiterated what was being done and everyone had to say \"check\" including me. Though I thought it was strange, it leaves little room for error if we are all on the same page. All went well and this test showed normalcy! Yeah! \n\nThen I went back again the other day. Well let's just say I couldn't not complete the test. It had nothing to do with Mayo at all, just me. My body was not cooperating. My Dr. called me within the hour to say he had been notified. He wanted to reassure me that it was OK, and we would discuss it at greater length in his office on my follow-up appointment. If I had any questions or concerns to feel free to call him at any time. Now that is a surprising change and I just loved it. Yes, I have not been feeling all too well since that day, but...",

    "text": "We had our very old and worn anthony pool resurfaced with micro pebble by AZ Pool and Spa Restoration. Don came and explained what we needed and gave two options to fit our budget. We chose AZ Pool & Spa because of a reasonable price, the length of warranty but mostly the professionalism of Don during our quote. Don explained things really well, but it wasn't in a condescending tone that women can sometimes get from contractors. He made me feel completely at ease and was very sweet when he learned I was recovering from breast cancer- saying that the pool would be great for my healing in a geniunely positive and not salesman way. We scheduled the chip out and the team that came were great. They worked quickly and kept the area clean as they worked. \nOther reviews have said that the communication was bad- I had the complete opposite experience! We were doing some of the work ourselves (tile and plumbing) and if I had any questions, Don responded very quickly; offering advice on the work we were doing ourselves. He didn't need to do that but he wanted to make sure we had information to ensure the renovation was the best it could be. Offering hints to my husband like pressurizing our new pipes until last minute so we could see if there were any leaks before we backfilled them. (great tip-worked great!) \nWe do have a very old anthony pool (about 50 yrs) so when the chip out was done, we found a lot of rusted rebar. Don had warned us ahead that was what Mike was going to inspect during the shell inspection after chip out, so I wasn't given any \"sticker shock\" when we needed to brownout our bottom and have some rusted rebar replaced. He was very upfront about the cost before we did chip out so those that say they were never told or had costs added on, perhaps weren't listening close enough during quote phase? \nAfter brown coat, Don was ready when we were. We just had to finish tile and let him know. We finished over the weekend and I texted him to let him know we were ready for the pebble finish. He was able to schedule for Monday! Again, opposite of what other reviews have said.\nI'm an early riser and told Don his guys could come as early as they wanted to hopefully avoid being too long in the sun. They were at my drive at 6.30am ready to start! Watching these guys work was something else (not hovering!) they were so professional and quick and again, kept the area clean. They did leave their slurry container outside after they left but after chatting with Don, I learned that it had to harden and they would pick up the next day, which they did.\nNext day they came to acid wash the pebble and again, quick and professional. After the guy left, Don called to let me know about filling the pool and what we had to do.\nThe pool took two days to fill. Mike, the other owner came by to put chemicals in. He gave a run down of what we needed to do for the first 30 days and some advice for thereafter. Again, in a non condescending way. \nThese two gentlemen were great to work with. They were respectful and professional. I had no problems with communication, no issues with the work done and an absolutely beautiful pool ready just in time for summer! \nThank you so much Mike and Don. I will be recommending you in the future!",

From the top fashion and luxury brands to places most of us need to visit every now and then like the Apple Store, it's all there.\n\n3.) they have a brand new app you can download to always be aware of some of the latest specials going on, or simply see their directory of restaurants, stores, and more, all in one spot! :) I'm all about saving time and this app does just that for a shopper. \n\n4. The mall is super clean and always got a great energy about it. Ever shipped at a mall where the atmosphere was just dead? Yea, Fashion Show is the opposite of that, you come alive there when you visit. Maybe it's the shopping euphoria that hits you, but either way you'll see how beautiful a mall this is when you visit.\n\n5. and lastly I'd just say plan to spend a while here. I recommend starting at the Starbucks so you have plenty of energy for the day. :) \n\nEnjoy everyone! I hope my tips and review help you. Happy Shopping :)\n\nHenry :)",

The space is the typical trendy style - concrete floors, metal, sparse, but also warm with those giant windows. That leather couch was very comfy and I spent hours there. The people and atmosphere were convivial and pleasant. The staff was AWESOME! Maybe its my coming from the East Coast, but these young people were gracious, efficient and very customer oriented. Like I said, I was there during tough times and this place provided a welcome and comforting respite.",

I was told to sign up for their player's card and you can get a full rack of ribs for $15 with sides.  We got their late on a Wednesday night and ordered one of their large $2 draft beers and a full rack.  After maybe 5 minutes this HUGE plate came out with a full rack and a side of slaw, BBQ beans and bread.  The ribs fell off the bone and had very good flavor.  The slaw was average, but the beans were very good!  It was too much food, but I couldn't leave a bone with meat on it!  If you're in Vegas and was good BBQ at a great price, Ellis Island is a place to go.  Plus the machines are good also!!!",

The fries need a make over however the fish was good and everything we have on one of the appetizer platers was cook amazing. First place I've been to in a while where I felt satisfied when I let.

(wasnt happy about that- my BF is larger- we were pretty squooshed in that bed!)\n\nNext day we had to try to get the 'right room' and had to stand in line at desk to do so (1/2 hour wait) and they gave us another room as they had said they would.\n\nUsually , in all the other hotels in Vegas they would upgrade or comp you something to try to make amends that first night- They didnt- and should have- moving rooms was a pain in the butt. I spoke with the front desk staff she was very \" I could give a rats ass if you stay here or not' and when I spoke with the manager on duty-even she didnt seem to care if I was unhappy or not.That fake smile was so annoying.\n\nIts not like the entire hotel was full- it was New years Day-everyone was checking OUT. \n\nTake note TI from Caesars,NYNY, and even CircusCircus - who have all done that ! Ive been to Las Vegas at least 10 times...Really TI?\n\nRoom was pretty standard-nothing spectacular- but bathroom and tub were nice size.\nHalls were really quiet and room was on 22nd floor with decent view.\n\nThe entrance where the check in is could use some updating- the colors are old and seventies and still a bit of that 'Pirate' flair which they look like they are moving away from.(and should - its not a daycare - its a hotel)",

Two weeks later and there is still a crease where this bubble had been.\n\nA week after initially getting the tint done on all of my windows, I had to go back to get my windshield and one of my side windows redone. There are still bubbles under all of the windows. When I asked about this I was told it takes up to two weeks to dry and evaporate completely. I was originally told 48 hours.\n\nHe was nice and was willing to replace my windshield tint no questions asked. However, I received a little push back when I asked to have my driver door redone because there were multiple felt pieces from the doorframe under the tint.

So management is a joke and upkeep of the property is non-existent.  The place is outdated and the equipment is from the 90s. Most of the spinning bikes don't have the ability for a rider to clip in and some don't even allow you to adjust the bike for safe riding. Pedaling is clicky and doesn't have a smooth circular motion. Bathrooms are foul. The ceilings are consistently leaking so part of your workout includes walking the halls and dodging the garbage cans set up to collect the water. The members, specifically the silver sneakers, are incredibly rude and it's not a place anyone would want to spend time. The ONLY thing the club had going for it was when it brought in an outside fitness studio and offered AWESOME and uplifting classes where you literally forgot you were dancing in a shitty gym. They've since left and so have I, and I would say that everyone is much happier. The club sucks. Don't go.",

    "text": "Best high end pool party venue in Vegas hands down. I believe it is also the largest pool on the strip. I've seen Afrojack and Deadmau5 spin at EBC and it's always been a good time. They get the best EDM DJ's in the world here(just like Marquee Day Club), so if you like pool parties and EDM this is the place to be. They have DJ's such as Tiesto, Avicii, Deadmau5, Afrojack, Steve Angello, Calvin Harris, Deniz Koyu...\n\nEntry:\nI can't stress this enough: Buy presale tickets online! If you know you are going to go beforehand, just do it. It'll save you lots of $$, about 50% off what you would pay at the door. You'll save lots of time waiting in line as well. The one time we didn't buy online presale tix, we had to wait in a super long line to get in the day of and it took forever. After waiting for over an hour and not moving very much we decided to do what you always do if you don't want to wait: Grease the bouncers. So we greased him a Benjamin and we finally got to the front where we then had to pay the full price which was something like $125 each. Ridiculous! If we had bought our tix online it would have been like $60. You can bring in a backpack but you can't bring in any outside food or drink and they inspect it very thoroughly. You cannot bring in eye drops or any medication. You will need to check it in at the front and then go back to get it if you need it. \n\nEnvironment:\nUnlike Marquee Day Club, there is plenty of space to find an area to sit either on the edge of the pool or on the side by one of the planters. The capacity of EBC is probably 3 times the size of Marquee Day Club, so it seems much more relaxed. Be warned, the music is very loud because they have speakers surrounding the entire pool which is actually quite impressive. I think I counted something like 80 speakers surrounding the pool all along the walls. Because of this there isn't really any place you can go where the music is not loud, so if you need a break from the noise you'll need to leave the pool or bring ear plugs. Since the pool is so large, you can easily find a place to take a quick dip on either side or in the middle in front of the DJ.  There is an area to dance in front of the DJ as well. \n\nFood/Drink:\nDrinks are ridiculously expensive which is expected at any Vegas club, almost $20 per drink after tax and tip. However food is actually pretty good here, and costs much less than alcohol! The chicken sandwich/wrap is what I order every single time. They also sell soda, powerade, water, and beer at the food window. The line usually moves much faster than the line at the bar, so if you just want a beer or soda or water, this is a good place to go. \n\nOne complaint about this place... the security is not very good, but as expected they probably are just temporary workers, not permanent. One time I was drinking my powerade and a head of security lady came up to me and told me I wasn't allowed to bring in outside food or drink and told me to throw it away. As you can imagine I was very confused since I had paid like $5 for it at the food window! So I argue with her for a little while and she still doesn't believe me so then my friends have to come and back me up and tell her that I really bought it at the food window, along with beer, water etc. Obviously she did not know what drinks they actually sold at the food window so she finally gave up and believed us. \n\nEBC sets the standard for how all other pool parties in Vegas should be, which is why I gave it 5 stars. People who give it four stars are just complaining about the service or price of drinks, but wtf do they expect? And where else is there a better pool party in Vegas? Marquee is the only other pool party that compares because they get all the popular DJ's too, and all the really hot model girls go there. But Marquee is way smaller, super cramped and crowded and the drinks cost just as much.",

Liz and Jackie were both patient and answered all my questions and concerns. \nThe office also had an atm machine which I thought was nice for making cash payments back on your loan.",

For two people the pub was perfect. The waitress appeared almost the moment we sat down. Ordered. Food came quick, hot ... happy to satisfy growing hunger pains. \n\nHubby ordered Chicken salad. No surprises.  My fish and steak fries satisfied. \n\nAt the table sat a computerized screen for paying the bill. LOVE it. Not only could we pay (with auto calculating tip meter), we used it to call the waitress for more salad dressing. No more hailing down harried wait staff. LOVE IT! And, before leaving, we answered a pretty lengthy online review, something I probably wouldn't have taken time for once I got home.\n\nNice to find reliable sources miles from home.",

It was a Tuesday night and the restaurant was slammed, yet service was still very good.\n\nWe ordered everything from beers to margaritas to tacos to pork buns to fried rice. I tried a bite of everything. The stand outs for me were:\n\n-Pollo con mole taco\n-Cochinita taco\n-Tuna ceviche\n\nOur waitress was very accomodating and helpful. The restaurant also allowed us to bring in our own dessert for the occasion. \n\nI know some reviewers have commented on how expensive they think China Poblano is for the food, but for us it was a great deal. Our bill totaled a little over $700 for 14 people, including alcohol and gratuity, which averaged around $50/person. Not bad at all considering it was a nice, fun meal with delicious food that lasted over 2 hours.\n\nIt's not my favorite restaurant in the Cosmo nor is it my go-to spot for tacos but for a fun, casual place to eat on that property I think China Poblano is a very solid choice.",

Within a couple days I was notified of a change in my insurance payment as well but was surprised to find that it was nearly a hundred dollars HIGHER than it usually is. I call customer service and after being transferred around between a few people who had no clue what they were doing I was linked up with a gentleman who informed me that I now have an increased payment do to the ZIP code that I now reside in being more dangerous and high risk (opposite of the reason my girlfriend's payment was dropped). Not to mention a couple of months ago we both got a letter of non-renewal form the company only to find out upon calling that it was yet another mistake from their end that led them to think that I had moved to Texas, yet when I looked outside it seemed to me that I was still in Oregon...............\n\nLong story short, I thought that I had found a good company to have insurance coverage with at last, but it turns out that Progressive is just as willing to lie and twist the reality that is insurance liability and risk to whatever form best fits THEIR needs.\n\nI've already canceled my policy and as someone who is in the automotive industry I have no problem steering the customers in need that I meet away from Progressive when they ask for my recommendation.",

Changed to 2 stars.  Delivery guy just showed up with food an hour and a half after i ordered. He played like he didn't know what I was talking about. I think they hurried, made food and delivered. My kids were ecstatic so we're happy now.  But the chow mein and moo goo gai pan were the exact same things.",

    "text": "My family is visiting Phoenix this week and I did plenty of Yelp research to find restaurants that could accommodate my gluten sensitive son. There were a few places with gluten free pizza, but we chose Sardellas since he could also get GF cheesy bread and the menu was clearly labeled with GF options. I was SO impressed with Sardellas! First, the cashier was very knowledgeable about the menu, they then stamp the ticket with gluten free so the kitchen is aware. My son loved his pizza! My other son got a slice of regular cheese and my husband and I got the buffalo chicken pizza. Overall we were very impressed by the cleanliness, food quality and attentiveness of the staff. We'll be back on our next trip down!",

I explained the issue and the first question he asked me what pool surface I had. I told him plaster and he advised not to drain it this time of the year as the other company suggested then he explained why as plaster will crack. I had no clue, Danny came out and did a once over on the pool then suggested their green to clean treatment and our pool went from green to clean in 2 days!! Looks amazing. I highly recommend Royalty Pools. Thanks for saving me a lot of money and being honest about the process.",

    "text": "First of all, this is a cafeteria style eating setup.  There are multiple food \"stands\" here, and you eat in a small area that is shared with others.  Not a big deal to me, but don't expect BWW or other establishment.  It is a cool idea though, more for college kids I think, since it is right near CSN.  \n\nOrdered the fried pickles, jalapeno bombers, and traditional wings of course.\n\nPickles were good...it is the sauce that makes them actually.  The pickles by themselves didn't do much for me, but the cajun/mayo/ranch whatever it was is pretty solid and goes well with the vinegary/saltiness.  Jalapeno bombers were not very good....pretty bland...would not recommend.\n\nAs for the wings, I saw them cook the entire batch at one time.  But somehow, some of them got overcooked and dry, others were absolutely perfect.  There were some with a lot of blood vessels or whatever it is called, and one of mine had a broken bone with marrow all around the insides and chunks of bone pieces...yuck.  These must be frozen and transported via UPS freight (jk...kind of)....\n\nTried the parm garlic, mango habenero (I think), and carribean jerk bbq.  The garlic parm was ok...the habenero was like a basic hot to me...both were good, but not great.  What WAS great was their carribean jerk.  It was an excellent, spicy mixture of bbq and jerk'ness and really really wish all the others had that much thought and love put into them.\n\nSince all the other reviews seemed great, I must have had a bad experience or bad choices in sauce at least.  If the wings were cooked right, it would have made this a 4 star, and more than one solid choice in flavor, would have bumped another outta me.  I guess I will stick with the chain restaurants for solid and consistent wings.",

That was until a last minute trip with a 92 year old friend looking to scratch something off his bucket list with a trip to the Bellagio and the O show.\n\nThe Bellagio was just amazing. From the hotel, the atmosphere, the welcoming friendly staff, the fountain, the super clean beautiful room with the awesome view, the cafe, the conservancy and the O show. Gambling was good too.\nIt was so good that I'm going back with the family in 2 weeks to spoil them too.\n\nI wish I got more names to single out some great staff. There was the young lady that checked us in and took special care of us. There is a very nice and the best beverage server at Bellagio with the purple highlights in her hair( liked her hair, let her keep the purple ) Maryann at Petrossian lounge is a sweetheart and Reatta the usher at the O show is the real star of that show. If more people were like her the world would be a better place.",

(Chef John) served us and we started with the sampler platter and worked our way down the menu. We had uni, Tuna Takaki salad, cucumber salad and just about everything else and ended with fresh mochi and a green tea Cree br??l??e. Right??  \n\nI'll just make a long story short. After driving 8 hours, being 9:00 at night it was the perfect way to end a great day. \n\nFind your way here and you won't regret it...and ask for Chef John if you really want VIP service. If you speak Taiwanese  you might even get a break on dessert :)",

But, there was no thought on calling his next scheduled appts at all. \nWhen the technician started troubleshooting I explained that we had had the Freon serviced less than 5 months ago. He topped of the freon and called it good. Sunday, we noticed that dripping water out of the intake vents again, which were FULL of water dripping from the FROZEN coil, again. We called the Home Warrantee company to recall the trouble call which they could not do because Cool Blew did not close the work order. Then, when they called back after the home warrantee company issued a recall order they couldn't schedule it for another 3 days. For work they did not complete. \nWith children and pets in the house its amazing they cannot back up their own work.
